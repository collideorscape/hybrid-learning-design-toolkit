# Hybrid Learning Space Mapping Canvas

## Overview

The Hybrid Learning Space Mapping Canvas is a visual design tool that helps educators create integrated learning environments for hybrid teaching. Unlike traditional classroom planning tools that focus on furniture arrangement or technology lists, this canvas guides educators through designing spaces that work seamlessly across what Bülow (2022) identifies as the "triple presence" of hybrid learning:

1. **Physical Classroom Environment** - The tangible space where in-person students and instructors interact
2. **Digital Environment** - The shared online platform connecting all participants
3. **Remote Students' Contexts** - The diverse home and remote environments where distant learners participate

By mapping these three interconnected contexts simultaneously, educators can design more equitable and effective hybrid learning spaces.

## The Challenge This Tool Addresses

Hybrid learning environments present unique spatial and pedagogical challenges that traditional classroom design approaches fail to address:

### The Triple Presence Challenge
As Bülow (2022) argues, hybrid teaching requires educators to be simultaneously present in three spaces—physical, digital, and remote. Traditional planning tools treat these as separate domains, leading to:
- Remote students feeling like "second-class citizens" observing from the periphery
- Poor integration between physical and digital learning activities
- Technical setups that work for one group but exclude others
- Cognitive overload for instructors trying to manage disconnected spaces

### The Visibility-Audibility-Participation Gap
Research by Raes et al. (2020) identifies three critical challenges in hybrid environments:
- **Visibility gaps**: Not all participants can see what they need to see
- **Audibility gaps**: Audio often works well for one group while excluding others
- **Participation gaps**: Engagement opportunities favor either in-person or remote students

### The Activity-Space Mismatch
Traditional classroom design starts with available space and technology, then tries to fit activities into these constraints. This approach often results in:
- Technology driving pedagogy rather than supporting it
- Rigid setups that don't adapt to different learning activities
- Missed opportunities for rich cross-location collaboration

## Theoretical Foundation

The Hybrid Learning Space Mapping Canvas integrates several key theoretical frameworks:

### 1. Spatial Pedagogy (Bülow, 2022)
Bülow's concept of "designing synchronous hybrid learning spaces" provides the foundational understanding that:
- Space is not neutral—it actively shapes learning possibilities
- Hybrid spaces exist simultaneously in multiple contexts
- Effective design requires considering all presence contexts equally
- The goal is integration, not mere connection, of spaces

### 2. Activity-Centered Analysis and Design (ACAD)
Drawing from Carvalho & Goodyear (2014) and Goodyear et al. (2021), the canvas applies ACAD's three analytical dimensions:
- **Set Design**: The physical and digital elements of the learning environment
- **Social Design**: How people interact and what roles they play
- **Epistemic Design**: The learning activities and knowledge-building tasks

The canvas particularly emphasizes how set design (space) must align with and support both social and epistemic design.

### 3. Community of Inquiry Framework
Garrison et al.'s (2000) framework informs the tool's attention to:
- **Teaching Presence**: How instructors establish their presence across all contexts
- **Social Presence**: How learners connect with each other regardless of location
- **Cognitive Presence**: How spaces support deep learning and inquiry

### 4. Empirical Research on Hybrid Learning
The tool incorporates findings from systematic studies including:
- Raes et al. (2020) on synchronous hybrid learning challenges
- Zydney et al. (2019) on "Here or There" instruction
- Wang et al. (2017) on design principles for blended synchronous learning
- Wagner et al. (2023) on engagement disparities in hybrid classrooms

## How the Canvas Works

### Core Components

#### 1. Central Visualization Grid
A flexible grid where educators:
- Define functional **activity zones** based on learning purposes (not just physical areas)
- Place key elements (cameras, displays, microphones, seating arrangements)
- Map sightlines and audio coverage
- Visualize traffic flow and transitions

#### 2. Triple Presence Analysis Matrix
For each activity zone, educators analyze:

|  | Physical Classroom | Digital Environment | Remote Students' Contexts |
|--|-------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| **Visibility** | What needs to be seen? By whom? | How is visual content shared? | What can remote students see? |
| **Audibility** | What needs to be heard? How? | How does audio bridge spaces? | Can remote students hear and be heard? |
| **Participation** | How do people engage here? | What interaction tools are used? | How do remote students fully participate? |

#### 3. Activity-Space Alignment Section
Connects spatial design to learning activities by asking:
- What learning activities will happen in each zone?
- How do these activities leverage the triple presence?
- What transitions occur between activities/zones?
- How does the space design support pedagogical goals?

#### 4. Gap Identification Prompts
Reflective questions that surface potential issues:
- Who might be excluded by this design?
- What assumptions are we making about technology access?
- Where are the potential failure points?
- How can we build in flexibility?

### Design Process

1. **Map Current or Envisioned Space**: Start with the physical classroom layout
2. **Define Activity Zones**: Based on learning functions, not furniture
3. **Analyze Triple Presence**: Work through the matrix for each zone
4. **Identify Gaps**: Use prompts to surface potential issues
5. **Iterate Design**: Adjust based on identified gaps
6. **Connect to Activities**: Ensure alignment with pedagogical plans

## Key Benefits

### 1. Shifts from Technology-First to Pedagogy-First Design
Rather than starting with available equipment, the canvas begins with learning goals and activities, then determines what spatial configurations and technologies best support them.

### 2. Makes Invisible Barriers Visible
By systematically analyzing each presence context, educators discover barriers they might otherwise miss—like remote students being unable to see small group work or hear peer discussions.

### 3. Promotes Equity by Design
The triple presence framework ensures remote students are considered as full participants from the start, not accommodated as an afterthought.

### 4. Supports Iterative Improvement
The visual nature allows for easy experimentation and adjustment before implementation, saving time and resources.

### 5. Facilitates Communication
The completed canvas serves as a communication tool for:
- IT departments understanding support needs
- Colleagues teaching in the same space
- Students understanding how to navigate the hybrid environment
- Administrators making resource decisions

## Use Cases

### New Hybrid Classroom Design
When setting up a classroom for hybrid teaching for the first time, the canvas helps make informed decisions about camera placement, microphone selection, and furniture arrangement based on intended activities.

### Existing Classroom Adaptation
For classrooms already equipped for hybrid teaching, the canvas reveals why certain activities aren't working and suggests specific adjustments.

### Activity-Specific Planning
When designing specific learning activities (like lab work, group discussions, or presentations), the canvas ensures the spatial setup supports rather than hinders the pedagogy.

### Troubleshooting Engagement Issues
When remote students report feeling disconnected or in-person students dominate discussions, the canvas helps identify spatial factors contributing to these dynamics.

### Professional Development
The canvas serves as a reflection tool in workshops, helping educators develop spatial thinking skills for hybrid environments.

## Design Principles Embedded in the Tool

1. **Equity First**: Remote participants are co-learners, not observers
2. **Activity Drives Design**: Space serves pedagogy, not vice versa
3. **Integration Over Connection**: Spaces should feel unified, not merely linked
4. **Flexibility as Foundation**: Designs must accommodate multiple activities
5. **Sensory Consideration**: Address sight, sound, and interaction holistically
6. **Failure Planning**: Anticipate and design for technical issues
7. **Student Agency**: Enable choice in how students engage across locations

## Relationship to the Hybrid Learning Design Toolkit

The Hybrid Learning Space Mapping Canvas serves as a bridge between:
- **Dimension 1** (Learning Environment & Technology Design): Provides the spatial foundation
- **Dimension 2** (Learning Experience & Assessment Design): Ensures spaces support planned activities
- **Dimension 3** (Facilitation, Equity & Community Design): Creates conditions for equitable participation

It transforms abstract concepts from the toolkit into concrete spatial decisions.

## Future Development Possibilities

1. **Digital Version with Simulation**: Interactive tool showing how design decisions affect different participants
2. **Pattern Library**: Common successful configurations for typical activities
3. **AR Visualization**: See the triple presence in augmented reality
4. **Integration Metrics**: Quantitative measures of spatial equity
5. **Student Feedback Integration**: Systematic way to incorporate learner perspectives

## Conclusion

The Hybrid Learning Space Mapping Canvas represents a paradigm shift in how we think about classroom design for hybrid learning. By making the triple presence visible and centering activity-based design, it helps educators create truly integrated learning environments where all students—regardless of location—can fully participate in the learning community.

Rather than treating hybrid as "classroom plus video," this tool recognizes hybrid learning as a fundamentally different spatial paradigm requiring intentional design across multiple interconnected contexts.
