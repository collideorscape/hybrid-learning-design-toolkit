# Hybrid Learning Participant Guide

## Introduction

This guide helps you participate effectively in hybrid learning experiences where some participants are in-person and others join remotely. Most importantly, it emphasizes your right to participate in ways that work best for you—your learning needs, comfort level, and circumstances matter.

In inclusive hybrid learning, there's no "right" way to participate. As research by CAST (2018) and Wang et al. (2017) shows, learning improves when students have choices in how they engage. This guide helps you understand and use those choices.

## Your Rights as a Hybrid Learner

Before diving into specifics, remember these fundamental rights:

- **Right to Choose**: Select participation modes that work for you
- **Right to Privacy**: Share only what you're comfortable sharing
- **Right to Access**: Receive content in formats you can use
- **Right to Time**: Process and respond at your pace when possible
- **Right to Change**: Switch modes based on your needs
- **Right to Support**: Ask for help without judgment

## Before Your First Session

### Assessing Your Needs and Preferences

Take time to consider:
- **Visual Preferences**: Do you prefer video on/off? Need larger text? Benefit from captions?
- **Audio Preferences**: Headphones or speakers? Need transcripts? Prefer text chat?
- **Participation Style**: Verbal, written, or visual responses? Synchronous or asynchronous?
- **Environment**: Quiet space available? Interruptions likely? Bandwidth limitations?
- **Support Needs**: Note-taking help? Extra time? Alternative formats?

### Technical Setup for Flexibility

**Core Requirements (with Alternatives):**
- **Device**: Any device that connects to internet (phone, tablet, laptop)
- **Internet**: Any stable connection (can be mobile hotspot)
- **Audio**: Built-in or external (headphones recommended but not required)
- **Camera**: Optional—never required for participation
- **Backup**: Phone number for audio-only participation

### Preparation for Full Participation

**Technical Preparation:**
- [ ] Test platform with YOUR preferred settings
- [ ] Set up your chosen display name/avatar
- [ ] Configure accessibility settings you need
- [ ] Practice using features you'll rely on
- [ ] Identify your backup participation method

**Learning Preparation:**
- [ ] Review materials in your preferred format
- [ ] Note questions in your comfortable mode
- [ ] Plan your participation approach
- [ ] Connect with support systems
- [ ] Set realistic goals for engagement

## During Hybrid Sessions

### Flexible Participation Strategies

#### Your Camera Choice
- **Camera ON**: If this helps you focus and connect
- **Camera OFF**: If you need privacy, bandwidth, or comfort
- **Avatar/Photo**: To maintain presence without live video
- **Switching**: Change anytime based on your needs

**Remember**: Your ideas matter more than your image

#### Your Audio Options
- **Speaking**: When comfortable and technically feasible
- **Text Chat**: Equally valid for contributions
- **Reactions/Emojis**: Quick, meaningful participation
- **Asynchronous**: Follow up later if needed

**Remember**: All communication modes are valued equally

#### Your Engagement Choices

**During Full Group Sessions:**
- Participate through your preferred channel
- Use private chat for clarification needs
- Take breaks as needed (camera off is fine)
- Process at your own pace

**During Breakout Activities:**
- Choose your communication mode
- Suggest alternatives if activities don't work
- Partner with others using different modes
- Document in your preferred format

**During Individual Work:**
- Work at your pace
- Use tools that work for you
- Ask for alternatives if needed
- Submit in your preferred format

### Managing Your Hybrid Experience

#### When You Need Different Access
- Use chat: "Could you describe what's on screen?"
- Private message: "I need this in text format"
- Speak up: "I'm participating through chat today"
- Email later: "I need extended time for this"

#### When Technology Isn't Working
- Don't panic—this is normal and okay
- Use your backup method
- Focus on learning, not perfect tech
- Follow up asynchronously if needed

#### When You Feel Excluded
- You belong—advocate for your needs
- Use private channels to request support
- Suggest specific accommodations
- Remember: Good instructors want you to succeed

## Transitions and Changes

### Mode Switching is Normal
- Start with camera, switch to audio-only
- Begin speaking, move to chat
- Try synchronous, shift to asynchronous
- Join physically, participate remotely

### Communicating Your Needs
- "I'll be camera-off today"
- "I'm participating through chat"
- "I need to step away briefly"
- "Could we have captions enabled?"
- "I'll follow up asynchronously"

No justification needed—just inform and participate

## Self-Advocacy Strategies

### Before Issues Arise
- Review syllabus for flexibility options
- Connect with instructor about needs
- Identify peer support partners
- Know your technical alternatives

### When Barriers Appear
- **Immediate**: Use prepared phrases to request alternatives
- **Private**: Message instructor with specific needs
- **Follow-up**: Email with longer-term solutions
- **Peer Support**: Connect with classmates for notes/support

### Building Your Support Network
- **Tech Buddy**: Someone comfortable with platforms
- **Note Partner**: Share notes in multiple formats
- **Study Group**: Mixed modality participants
- **Instructor**: Your advocate for access

## Inclusive Learning Strategies

### Making the Most of Choice
1. **Experiment**: Try different modes to find what works
2. **Adapt**: Change strategies based on content/context
3. **Combine**: Use multiple modes simultaneously
4. **Document**: Keep track of what works for you

### Contributing to Inclusive Community
- Share notes in multiple formats
- Describe visual content in chat
- Summarize verbal discussions in text
- Support peers with different needs
- Celebrate diverse participation styles

### Your Learning, Your Way
- Take notes in your preferred format
- Process information at your pace
- Demonstrate learning through chosen medium
- Build on your strengths
- Honor your needs

## Technical Tips for Agency

### Customizing Your Experience
- **Platform Settings**: Explore all accessibility options
- **Browser Tools**: Use reader mode, zoom, extensions
- **Personal Tools**: Bring your assistive technology
- **Multiple Devices**: Use phone + computer if helpful

### Bandwidth Management
- Turn off video when needed
- Use phone for audio, computer for visuals
- Download materials in advance
- Have offline alternatives ready

### Creating Your Workspace
- **Physical**: Arrange for your comfort/needs
- **Digital**: Organize screens your way
- **Temporal**: Build in breaks/processing time
- **Social**: Set boundaries as needed

## Implementation Level Considerations

### If Your Class is "Essential" Level
- Basic tools, maximum flexibility
- Focus on core participation
- Simple alternatives always available
- Your comfort prioritized

### If Your Class is "Enhanced" Level
- More options to explore
- Sophisticated tools to customize
- Greater peer collaboration possibilities

## Remember Your Agency

You are not a passive recipient of hybrid learning—you are an active agent in creating inclusive learning experiences. Your needs, preferences, and innovations help make hybrid learning better for everyone.

When you advocate for your access needs, you help create a more inclusive environment for all. When you participate in your preferred mode, you model the diversity that enriches our learning community.

## Conclusion

Hybrid learning works best when everyone can participate authentically. Use this guide to understand your options, but remember—you know your needs best. 

Your learning journey is unique, and hybrid environments should flex to support it.
