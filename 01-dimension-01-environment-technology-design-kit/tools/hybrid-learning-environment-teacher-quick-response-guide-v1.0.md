## PRE-SESSION INCLUSIVE READINESS CHECK (60-SECONDS)

| Check | Action | What to Look For |
|-------|--------|------------------|
| 👁️ **Visibility** | "Can everyone access visual content in a way that works for you? Cameras are optional." | Confirm participants can see/access content via their preferred method |
| 🔊 **Audibility** | "If you can hear me, give a thumbs up, type YES in chat, or signal however works for you" | Look for varied response types - all are valid |
| 🤝 **Participation** | "Let's test our response options - respond using any method: voice, chat, reactions, or gestures" | Verify multiple participation channels work |
| 📹 **Room View** | "Remote participants, can you see/sense what's happening in the room through video, audio, or chat descriptions?" | Ensure room activity is communicated multimodally |
| 🎤 **Room Audio** | "I'll have someone speak from different room positions - signal if you need captions or text summaries" | Check audio reaches all + alternatives available |
| 🔄 **Flexibility** | "Remember you can switch between video/audio/text participation anytime based on your needs" | Normalize flexible participation modes |

## TOP 5 INCLUSIVE SCENARIOS & SOLUTIONS

| Scenario | Quick Inclusive Solution | Proactive Prevention |
|----------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| 🔇 **Audio Participation Varies** | 1. "Audio is one option - chat and reactions equally valued"<br>2. Monitor all channels simultaneously<br>3. Read chat contributions aloud<br>4. Pause for text responses | Start with multi-modal participation as norm |
| 📵 **Varied Connection Quality** | 1. "If you're frozen/disconnected, you're still with us"<br>2. Share key points in persistent chat<br>3. Record for async access<br>4. Assign note-taking buddies | Design for lowest bandwidth from start |
| 🖥️ **Screen Sharing Access** | 1. Verbally describe all visual content<br>2. Share materials in advance<br>3. Provide text summaries in chat<br>4. Use multiple formats simultaneously | Never rely solely on screen share |
| 👁️ **Camera Preferences** | 1. "Cameras optional - your comfort matters"<br>2. Use names/avatars for presence<br>3. Focus on voice/text participation<br>4. Validate all presence modes | Establish camera-optional culture |
| 🤝 **Engagement Tool Barriers** | 1. "Multiple ways to participate - choose what works"<br>2. Always have 3+ response options<br>3. Value all contribution types equally<br>4. Time flexibility for responses | Design activities with built-in choice |

## RAPID ACTIVITY PIVOTS - UNIVERSAL DESIGN

### When VISIBILITY is a Barrier for Some
- **Multi-Sensory Sharing**: Describe visually while typing key points, sharing links, and enabling captions
- **Peer Support Networks**: "If you can see clearly, help describe for others in chat"
- **Format Flexibility**: "Same content available as: video, slides, text doc, audio description"

### When AUDIBILITY is a Barrier for Some
- **Communication Redundancy**: Speak while typing, use visual cues, share summaries
- **Multi-Channel Monitoring**: "I'm watching chat, reactions, and listening - contribute however you prefer"
- **Time Flexibility**: "Take a moment to type your thoughts if speaking isn't working for you right now"

### When PARTICIPATION is a Barrier for Some
- **Choice Architecture**: "You can: speak, type, react, draw, or show me later"
- **Comfort Zones**: "Participate from your comfort zone - all contributions valued"
- **Buddy System**: "Partner with someone using a different mode than you"

## EMERGENCY INCLUSIVE COMMUNICATIONS

### Support Contacts
- IT Support: _____________________ (voice/text)
- Co-host/TA: ____________________ (multiple contact methods)
- Accessibility Support: ___________ (24/7 availability)

### Inclusive Response Scripts
- **Any Barrier**: "We're experiencing a challenge. Let's solve this together with flexibility."
- **Access Issue**: "If you can't [see/hear/participate] in the usual way, please [alternative method]."
- **Tech Problem**: "Technical issues are opportunities for creative solutions. Here are three ways to continue..."
- **Comfort**: "Your learning matters more than perfect tech. Engage however feels right."
- **Continuity**: "Everything is available in multiple formats on the LMS - no one will miss out."

## 30-SECOND INCLUSIVE RECOVERY

When any barrier appears:

1. **ACKNOWLEDGE** (5 sec): "I see we have an access challenge - that's okay"
2. **ANNOUNCE OPTIONS** (20 sec): "Here are 3 ways to continue: [list options]"
3. **AFFIRM CHOICE** (5 sec): "Choose what works for you - all options are equal"

## ACTIVITY TRANSITIONS - FLEXIBLE PATHWAYS

### For Group Work
- **Entry**: "Moving to groups - join via video, audio only, or chat only. In-room folks, you can stay physical or join digitally. Choose your comfort mode."
- **During**: "Contribute through speaking, typing, drawing, or gesturing - all modes welcome"
- **Exit**: "Share your group's work through any format - live presentation, chat summary, visual, or async post"

### For Any Tool Use
- **Introduction**: "We'll use [tool], but if that doesn't work for you, here are alternatives..."
- **During Use**: "Having trouble? No problem - participate through [alternatives]"
- **Follow-up**: "I'll share a summary for anyone who couldn't access the tool fully"

### Normalizing Flexibility
- **Regular Reminders**: "Remember, switch modes anytime based on your needs"
- **Celebration**: "I love seeing people participate in different ways - that's inclusive learning!"
- **No Justification Needed**: "Use whatever mode works - no explanation necessary"

### INCLUSIVE QUICK REFERENCE:
- 👁️ = Visual access (not just "seeing")
- 🔊 = Audio access (not just "hearing")  
- 🤝 = Participation access (not just "engaging")
- ❤️ = Comfort and choice matter
- 🔄 = Flexibility is normal, not special

### CORE PRINCIPLES:
- Assume variability in every session
- Provide choices without requiring disclosure
- Value all participation modes equally
- Technical "failures" are flexibility opportunities
- Comfort and access trump compliance
