# Hybrid Learning Technology Selection Guide

## Overview

This Technology Selection Guide helps educators choose appropriate technologies based on the three fundamental challenges of hybrid learning: ensuring all participants can **see** what they need to see, **hear** what they need to hear, and **participate** fully in learning activities. 

Rather than starting with available technology, this guide encourages you to first identify your needs across these three dimensions—as explored in the Hybrid Learning Space Mapping Canvas—then select technologies that address those specific needs while assuming learner variability from the start.

## Purpose and Benefits

- **Need-Based Selection**: Choose technologies based on identified visibility, audibility, and participation requirements
- **Variability-Aware Decisions**: Consider how technology serves participants with different abilities, preferences, and contexts
- **Budget-Conscious Options**: Provides alternatives across different resource levels
- **Activity-Aligned Choices**: Links technology selection to specific learning activities
- **Flexibility-First Approach**: Prioritizes technologies that offer multiple ways to engage

## Using This Guide

1. **Complete your Hybrid Learning Space Mapping Canvas first** to identify specific needs
2. **Review each dimension** considering both content access AND social presence
3. **Select flexible technologies** that accommodate learner variability
4. **Consider integration** - how will these technologies work together?
5. **Plan for contingencies** using the Hybrid Environment & Technology Resilience Guide

## Technology Integration Strategies

### Creating Flexible Systems

Rather than selecting technologies in isolation, build ecosystems that support variability:

1. **Universal Access Architecture**
   - Start with most accessible options as default
   - Build up from there based on preferences
   - Never require single-mode participation
   - Always provide alternatives

2. **Learner Choice Integration**
   - Allow switching between tools mid-session
   - Support personal tool preferences
   - Enable customization without stigma
   - Remember settings across sessions

3. **Redundancy as Flexibility**
   - Multiple paths to same outcome
   - Overlapping capabilities across tools
   - Graceful degradation when needed
   - No single point of exclusion

### Budget-Conscious Flexibility Options

| Need | Free/Low-Cost Flexible Option | Standard Flexible Option | Premium Adaptive Option |
|------|------------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| **Multi-View Camera** | Smartphone + tripod (multiple angles) | PTZ camera with presets | AI-tracking multi-camera array |
| **Flexible Audio** | Built-in captions + chat | Professional captions + zones | Real-time translation + spatial |
| **Participation Tools** | Google Forms + Jamboard | Mentimeter + Miro | Custom platforms with AI |
| **Collaboration** | Google Workspace (accessibility features) | Microsoft 365 (immersive reader) | Specialized inclusive platforms |

## Accessibility as Foundation, Not Feature

When evaluating any technology, ask:

1. **Who might be excluded by this choice?**
   - Consider sensory, motor, cognitive, and technical barriers
   - Think about comfort levels and privacy needs
   - Account for bandwidth and device limitations

2. **What assumptions does this technology make?**
   - About user abilities and contexts
   - About "normal" ways of participating
   - About resources and support available

3. **How can we provide meaningful alternatives?**
   - That achieve the same learning goals
   - Without stigma or extra burden
   - With equal richness of experience

## Decision Support Tool

### Technology Flexibility Checklist

For each technology decision:
- [ ] Offers multiple ways to access content?
- [ ] Provides various methods for engagement?
- [ ] Supports different expression formats?
- [ ] Works across device types and connections?
- [ ] Includes built-in accessibility features?
- [ ] Allows personalization without stigma?
- [ ] Integrates with assistive technologies?
- [ ] Provides alternatives for each core function?

### Red Flags to Avoid
- Technologies that require specific abilities
- Single-mode participation requirements
- Platform-locked experiences
- Inflexible interfaces
- Limited customization options
- Accessibility as "add-on" rather than built-in
