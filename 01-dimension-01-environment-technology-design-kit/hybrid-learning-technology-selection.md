## Overview
Choosing technology for hybrid learning often starts backwards—with available tools rather than pedagogical needs. The Technology Selection Guide reframes this process around three fundamental questions: What do participants need to see? What do they need to hear? How do they need to participate? This need-based approach ensures technology serves learning rather than constraining it.

> **Tip:** Start with the "What do participants need to see/hear/do?" questions before exploring specific technology options.

## Purpose
The Technology Selection Guide helps educators make informed choices by:

- Starting with pedagogical needs rather than technology features
- Organizing selection criteria by visibility, audibility, and participation requirements
- Providing budget-conscious alternatives across implementation levels
- Highlighting red flags for exclusionary technology choices
- Considering learner variability in every technology decision
- Matching technology sophistication to institutional readiness
- Building flexible technology ecosystems rather than isolated tools

## How It Works

The guide uses a structured decision-making process beginning with need identification across see/hear/participate dimensions. For each need category, it provides technology options ranging from basic to advanced, with clear cost implications and accessibility considerations. Integration strategies help create coherent technology ecosystems, while red flag checklists prevent common pitfalls.
