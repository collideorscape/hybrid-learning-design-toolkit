# 🏗️ Environment & Technology Design Kit

Create integrated learning spaces where all participants can engage equitably, regardless of location.

## 💡 The Core Question

Can all participants see what they need to see, hear what they need to hear, and participate as they need to participate—regardless of their location, abilities, resources, or learning preferences? This dimension addresses the technological, spatial, and accessibility foundations that make equitable hybrid learning possible for diverse learners with varying needs, circumstances, and ways of engaging.
