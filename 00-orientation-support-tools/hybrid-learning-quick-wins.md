## Overview
Quick wins are evidence-based strategies that can be implemented immediately with minimal preparation or resources, yet produce noticeable improvements in hybrid teaching effectiveness. The Quick Wins Guides provide two complementary resources: Universal practices that benefit all hybrid educators regardless of context, and Dimension-specific strategies tailored to your identified starting point. Together, these guides ensure educators can begin improving their hybrid teaching immediately while building confidence for larger transformations.
