## Overview
Quick wins are evidence-based strategies that can be implemented immediately with minimal preparation or resources, yet produce noticeable improvements in hybrid teaching effectiveness. The Quick Wins Guides provide two complementary resources: Universal practices that benefit all hybrid educators regardless of context, and Dimension-specific strategies tailored to your identified starting point. Together, these guides ensure educators can begin improving their hybrid teaching immediately while building confidence for larger transformations.

## Purpose
The Quick Wins Guides serve as action catalysts within the Orientation and Support Tools, enabling educators to:

- Implement proven universal strategies without prior assessment
- Access dimension-specific quick wins tailored to chosen focus areas
- Find level-appropriate actions matching readiness (Essential or Enhanced)
- Build confidence through immediate, visible improvements
- Create momentum for deeper transformations
- Connect quick actions to comprehensive toolkit resources
- Establish foundational practices while pursuing targeted development

## How It Works
The guides function at two levels:

**General Quick Wins** presents essential practices organized into four categories (pre-session rituals, attention management, participation equity, technology resilience) that work in any hybrid context.

**Quick Wins by Starting Dimension** provides 2-4 targeted strategies based on Decision Tree results, tailored to the chosen dimension (Environment & Technology, Learning Experience & Assessment, or Facilitation, Equity & Community) and implementation level.

Quick Wins are immediately implementable practices that deliver measurable improvements in hybrid teaching effectiveness. These strategies target specific readiness levels within each dimension (Environment & Technology, Learning Experience & Assessment, or Facilitation, Equity & Community) and implementation level.
