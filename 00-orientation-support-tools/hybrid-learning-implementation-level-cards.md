# Implementation Level Cards

<span style="background: #6f42c1; color: white; padding: 4px 10px; border-radius: 16px; font-size: 12px; font-weight: 500; white-space: nowrap; display: inline-block; margin-bottom: 24px;">Card Collection</span>

This Implementation Levels Cards helps you understand the three levels of hybrid teaching sophistication available across all dimensions of the Hybrid Learning Design Toolkit. Rather than prescribing a single "correct" approach, these levels acknowledge that effective hybrid teaching can happen at different depths of implementation based on your context, experience, and available resources.

## Understanding Implementation Levels

Think of implementation levels as **depths of engagement** rather than quality judgments:
- **Essential**: Building strong foundations with reliable, straightforward approaches
- **Enhanced**: Intentionally integrating hybrid affordances with moderate redesign
- **Transformative**: Innovating to create experiences only possible in hybrid formats

You might operate at different levels across different dimensions, or even use different levels for different activities within a single course. The goal is to match your approach to your current capacity while maintaining educational effectiveness.

## How These Guides Connects to the Toolkit

This guide works as a companion to several key components:

- **Hybrid Teaching Compass**: After completing your self-assessment, use this guide to understand what your readiness profile means in practical terms
- **Decision Tree for Starting Dimension**: Once you've identified where to begin, this guide shows you what to expect at your recommended implementation level
- **Dimension-Specific Tools**: Each tool in the three dimensions includes implementation level indicators—this guide explains what those levels mean
- **Quick Wins Guides**: The quick wins are organized by implementation level; this guide helps you understand why certain activities are suggested for your level
