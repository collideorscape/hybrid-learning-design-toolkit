# Implementation Level Cards

This Implementation Levels Cards helps you understand the three levels of hybrid teaching sophistication available across all dimensions of the Hybrid Learning Design Toolkit. Rather than prescribing a single "correct" approach, these levels acknowledge that effective hybrid teaching can happen at different depths of implementation based on your context, experience, and available resources.

## Understanding Implementation Levels

Think of implementation levels as **depths of engagement** rather than quality judgments:
- **Essential**: Building strong foundations with reliable, straightforward approaches
- **Enhanced**: Intentionally integrating hybrid affordances with moderate redesign
- **Transformative**: Innovating to create experiences only possible in hybrid formats

You might operate at different levels across different dimensions, or even use different levels for different activities within a single course. The goal is to match your approach to your current capacity while maintaining educational effectiveness.
