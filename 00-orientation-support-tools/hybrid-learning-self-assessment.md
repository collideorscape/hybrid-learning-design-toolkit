## Overview

Effective hybrid teaching requires awareness of one's capabilities across multiple dimensions. The Hybrid Learning and Teaching Self-Assessment Tool (also called the "Hybrid Learning Teaching Compass") provides a comprehensive framework for educators to evaluate their readiness across the three essential dimensions of hybrid teaching, creating a visual representation of current capabilities and targeted growth areas.

## Purpose
The Self-Assessment Tool serves as a foundational orientation instrument, enabling educators to:

- Reflect deeply on current hybrid teaching practices across 30 guided prompts
- Identify capability levels (1-5) for each dimension
- Consider institutional context and available support
- Generate a visual compass diagram showing readiness profile
- Match to one of 8 research-based readiness profiles
- Receive tailored recommendations for development priorities
- Create personalized implementation pathways
