# Hybrid Learning and Teaching Self-Assessment Rubric

## Introduction
Based on your reflections, select the capability level that best represents your current practice in each dimension. Your selections will determine appropriate implementation levels in the Hybrid Learning Design Toolkit.

## Dimension 1: Learning Environment & Technology Design

Based on your synthesis of reflection insights, select the level that best describes your current capability:

| Level | Description | Implementation Zone | Select |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|--------|
| **1 - EMERGING** | I'm still learning the basics of hybrid technologies and need substantial guidance. I have limited experience with physical-virtual space integration and require step-by-step guidance for technical setup. My technology choices are primarily based on availability rather than pedagogical fit, and I struggle to adapt my teaching when technical issues arise. | Essential | □ |
| **2 - DEVELOPING** | I can use standard video conferencing and basic digital tools. I have a basic understanding of room setup considerations but require support for more complex technological integration. I can make some connections between technology choices and learning objectives, but my approach primarily adapts traditional teaching methods rather than creating new possibilities. | Essential | □ |
| **3 - FUNCTIONAL** | I'm comfortable managing standard hybrid classroom technology and can create workable physical-virtual learning environments. I can resolve common technical challenges and implement basic accessibility considerations. I select technologies that support specific learning goals and can adapt my teaching methods to leverage available tools to create effective learning experiences across modalities. | Enhanced | □ |
| **4 - PROFICIENT** | I confidently integrate multiple technologies and design effective physical-virtual learning spaces. I anticipate and prevent most technical issues and implement comprehensive accessibility solutions. I deliberately select technologies that enable specific pedagogical approaches and can design learning activities that take advantage of the affordances of both physical and virtual participation. | Enhanced | □ |
| **5 - ADVANCED** | I innovatively combine technologies for seamless experiences and create highly integrated physical-virtual environments. I develop sophisticated technical contingency systems and pioneer new approaches to accessibility and equity. My technology decisions are driven by pedagogical vision, enabling learning experiences that would be impossible in traditional settings, with a seamless integration of pedagogical goals and technological affordances. | Transformative | □ |

## Dimension 2: Learning Experience & Assessment Design

Based on your synthesis of reflection insights, select the level that best describes your current capability:

| Level | Description | Implementation Zone | Select |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|--------|
| **1 - EMERGING** | I'm still adapting my teaching approach for hybrid contexts with minimal modifications to existing course materials. My activities primarily replicate traditional formats regardless of student location. I tend to use the same assessment methods for all students without significant adaptation for hybrid contexts. I struggle to provide equivalent learning experiences across participation modes. | Essential | □ |
| **2 - DEVELOPING** | I can adapt simple learning activities for hybrid delivery but find more complex ones challenging. I provide clear instructions for both participation modes but haven't fully redesigned my course for the hybrid context. My assessment approaches are slightly modified for hybrid teaching, but I'm still working on ensuring full equity. I offer basic flexibility in how students engage with content. | Essential | □ |
| **3 - FUNCTIONAL** | I intentionally redesign activities to function effectively across participation modes. I implement specific strategies to manage cognitive load for both myself and students. My assessments are designed with hybrid equity in mind, providing equivalent experiences regardless of location. I incorporate regular formative feedback mechanisms and offer reasonable flexibility in learning pathways. | Enhanced | □ |
| **4 - PROFICIENT** | I design integrated learning experiences that leverage the affordances of hybrid formats. My course structure intentionally balances flexibility and guidance with well-designed supports for diverse participation patterns. I implement innovative assessment approaches specifically optimized for hybrid contexts. My learning design facilitates meaningful interaction between students regardless of location. | Enhanced | □ |
| **5 - ADVANCED** | I create transformative learning experiences unique to hybrid formats that wouldn't be possible in single-mode settings. I seamlessly transition between physical and digital spaces in ways that enhance the learning journey. My course design offers highly personalized paths with strong scaffolding that supports student agency while maintaining rigor. My assessment approaches leverage the unique capabilities of hybrid environments in authentic ways. | Transformative | □ |

## Dimension 3: Facilitation, Equity & Community Design

Based on your synthesis of reflection insights, select the level that best describes your current capability:

| Level | Description | Implementation Zone | Select |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|--------|
| **1 - EMERGING** | I struggle to keep remote students as engaged as those who are present in-person. My facilitation approach tends to prioritize one participation mode over the other. I implement few specific strategies for community building across modalities. I find it challenging to monitor and respond to the engagement of all students simultaneously. I have limited approaches for supporting student agency in hybrid contexts. | Essential | □ |
| **2 - DEVELOPING** | I implement basic inclusion strategies to acknowledge all participants. I use simple rotation of attention between student groups but sometimes overlook remote participants. I create structured participation opportunities but may not consistently balance engagement across modes. I implement introductory community-building activities but struggle to maintain connection throughout the course. I provide basic guidance for student participation choices. | Essential | □ |
| **3 - FUNCTIONAL** | I create engaging experiences for both participation modes with intentional facilitation strategies. I implement effective protocols for balancing attention and participation across student groups. I monitor and manage engagement patterns to ensure relative equity. I facilitate meaningful cross-modal interaction between students in different locations. I address belonging and inclusion challenges with specific approaches. | Enhanced | □ |
| **4 - PROFICIENT** | I design sophisticated approaches to engagement that foster strong connections across modalities. I implement strategic techniques to create parallel participation opportunities across locations. I facilitate multiple participation channels with effective monitoring systems. I develop ongoing community-building activities that transcend physical separation. I provide frameworks that support informed student choice and agency. | Enhanced | □ |
| **5 - ADVANCED** | I pioneer innovative engagement approaches that fully integrate physical and virtual spaces into a unified learning environment. My facilitation appears seamless across modes with dynamic techniques that respond to emerging needs. I develop deep community that transcends location limitations, creating genuine connection regardless of participation mode. I implement fluid boundary-crossing interaction patterns where modality becomes increasingly irrelevant to participation quality. | Transformative | □ |
