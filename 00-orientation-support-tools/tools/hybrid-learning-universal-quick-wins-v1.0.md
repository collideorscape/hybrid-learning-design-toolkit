# Universal Quick Wins for Hybrid Teaching

## Essential Starting Points for Every Hybrid Educator

These quick wins apply regardless of your experience level, institutional context, or readiness profile. Each can be implemented immediately with minimal resources while creating meaningful impact on your hybrid teaching effectiveness.

### 🎯 Before Every Session

**Remote Student View Check**
- Take 30 seconds at session start to ask: "Can remote students see and hear clearly?"
- Have a remote student confirm what's visible on their screen
- Adjust camera/materials based on their feedback
- *Impact: Prevents entire sessions where remote students miss critical content*

### 🛠️ Basic Technology Foundations

**Simple Backchannel**
- Enable chat in your video platform for questions during class
- Check it every 5-10 minutes or assign a student monitor
- *Impact: Creates continuous participation opportunity for all students*

**One-Page Tech Guide**
- Create a simple troubleshooting guide for common issues
- Include: audio problems, video issues, connection tips
- Share with students and keep handy during sessions
- *Impact: Reduces disruption time and student anxiety*

### 📚 Inclusive Instructional Practices

**Hybrid-Friendly Instructions**
- Always state instructions both verbally and in writing
- Explicitly address both "here" and "there" students
- Example: "On-site students turn to your neighbor, remote students use breakout rooms"
- *Impact: Ensures no student group is accidentally excluded*

**Name Usage Protocol**
- Always use names when calling on any student
- Keep a visible list of all participants (not just remote)
- *Impact: Maintains equal presence and recognition*

### 👥 Building Connection

**Two-Minute Check-Ins**
- Start with a quick round: "One word describing your day"
- Alternate between on-site and remote students
- Keep it brief but consistent
- *Impact: Creates routine connection across all participants*

**Cross-Modal Partnerships**
- Pair one on-site with one remote student for activities
- Rotate partnerships regularly
- Use for quick discussions, peer review, or tech support
- *Impact: Builds bridges between physical and virtual spaces*

### 📊 Engagement Monitoring

**Visual Participation Tracking**
- Keep a simple tally of who speaks (both groups)
- If imbalanced, intentionally call on quieter group
- Share this practice transparently with students
- *Impact: Prevents unintentional marginalization*

### 💡 Implementation Wisdom

1. **Start with just 2-3 quick wins** - Don't overwhelm yourself
2. **Be consistent** - Regular use matters more than perfection
3. **Seek feedback** - Ask students: "Is this working for you?"
4. **Iterate quickly** - Small adjustments are better than major overhauls
5. **Share successes** - What works for you might help a colleague

### 🚀 Your First Step

Choose ONE quick win from this list and commit to using it in your next hybrid session. Once it feels natural (usually 2-3 sessions), add another. Building hybrid teaching excellence is a marathon, not a sprint.
