# How to Use the Hybrid Learning and Teaching Self-Assessment Kit
## Simplified Instructions

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for using the Hybrid Learning and Teaching Self-Assessment Kit to evaluate your hybrid teaching readiness and determine appropriate implementation strategies.

## Two Pathways to Assessment

You can complete the assessment using either:
1. **Standalone Components** - Print or digital documents you work through manually
2. **Interactive Tool** - Web-based application that guides you through the process

Both approaches will lead to the same outcome: a personalized readiness profile with implementation recommendations.

## Using the Standalone Components

### Step 1: Reflection Process
1. Open the **Reflection Prompts** document (HTML or MD version)
2. For each dimension, read through the reflection prompts and consider your current practices
3. Take notes in the synthesis space provided
4. Focus on identifying patterns and themes in your practice

### Step 2: Capability Assessment
1. Open the **Assessment Rubric** document (HTML or MD version)
2. For each dimension, read through the capability level descriptions
3. Select the level that best matches your current practice based on your reflections
4. Note your selected level for each dimension (1-5)

### Step 3: Institutional Context Assessment
1. Review the institutional context descriptions in the **Compass Visualization** document
2. Reflect on your institutional support for hybrid teaching
3. Select the support level that best represents your context (1-5)

### Step 4: Plot Your Results on the Compass
1. Locate your capability level on each axis of the compass
2. Mark each point on the compass visualization
3. Connect the points to create your "readiness shape"

### Step 5: Interpret Your Results
1. Open the **Readiness Profiles** document
2. Identify which profile best matches your readiness shape
3. Read about the implementation recommendations for your profile
4. Consider how your institutional context affects implementation

## Using the Interactive Tool

### Step 1: Access and Begin
1. Open the **Interactive Assessment Tool** (HTML)
2. Read the introduction and click "Begin Assessment"

### Step 2: Complete Each Section
1. **Dimension 1 Assessment**:
   - Read the reflection prompts (click "Show Reflection Prompts")
   - Select the capability level that best represents your practice
   - Click "Next" to proceed

2. **Dimension 2 Assessment**:
   - Follow the same process for Learning Experience & Assessment Design
   - Select your capability level and proceed

3. **Dimension 3 Assessment**:
   - Follow the same process for Facilitation, Equity & Community Design
   - Select your capability level and proceed

4. **Institutional Context Assessment**:
   - Review the support level descriptions
   - Click on the slider point that best represents your context
   - Click "View Results" to proceed

### Step 3: Review Your Results
1. Examine your readiness visualization on the compass
2. Read your readiness profile analysis
3. Review the implementation recommendations provided
4. Use the export options to save or print your results

## Tips for Effective Assessment

* **Be honest** in your self-assessmentâ€”this is a developmental tool, not an evaluation
* **Consider specific examples** from your practice when reflecting on prompts
* **Focus on current capabilities**, not aspirations or past practices
* **Involve colleagues** in the process for additional perspectives
* **Revisit the assessment** periodically (every 6-12 months) to track development

## What to Do With Your Results

1. **Identify priority dimensions** for development based on your profile
2. **Select appropriate implementation levels** based on both capability and context
3. **Create a development plan** focused on specific areas for growth
4. **Share results with colleagues** to foster collaborative improvement
5. **Use toolkit components** corresponding to your implementation levels

Remember, the Hybrid Learning and Teaching Self-Assessment Kit is designed as a formative tool to guide professional development and implementation planning, not as an evaluative measure of teaching quality.
