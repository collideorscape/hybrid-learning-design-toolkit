# Hybrid Learning and Teaching Readiness Profiles

This document provides comprehensive descriptions of the eight readiness profiles identified in the Hybrid Teaching Compass. Each profile represents a distinct pattern of capabilities across the three dimensions of the Hybrid Learning Design Toolkit, with specific implications for implementation planning.

## Dimension-Dominant Profiles

These profiles are characterized by notably higher capability in one dimension compared to the others.

### 1. Environment & Technology-Forward Profile

**Definition**: Strongest capabilities in Dimension 1 (Learning Environment & Technology Design) compared to other dimensions.

**Research Foundation**: This profile aligns with Mishra & Koehler's (2006) TPACK framework emphasis on technological knowledge integration. Research by Bower et al. (2015) identified technology infrastructure as a critical success factor in hybrid learning environments, while Wagner et al. (2023) found that audio/video quality and technological stability are primary determinants of student engagement in hybrid contexts.

**Key Characteristics**:
- Strong technical infrastructure skills and physical-virtual space design
- Effective technology selection, integration, and troubleshooting
- Developed contingency planning for technical failures
- Need for further development in learning design or facilitation techniques

**Implementation Approach**:
- Leverage technological strengths as a foundation for hybrid teaching
- Implement at the highest supportable level in the Technology dimension
- Start with Essential implementation in other dimensions regardless of Technology dimension level
- Progressively develop pedagogical approaches and facilitation techniques
- Focus on activities that can be supported by existing technological proficiency

**Quick Start Actions**:
Based on this profile, consider these immediate implementations:

## General Implementation Guidance for All Profiles

Regardless of your readiness profile, these implementation principles will support your hybrid teaching development:

1. **Start small**: Choose 1-2 quick wins to implement immediately rather than attempting comprehensive transformation
2. **Seek feedback**: Ask students about their experience with implementations to guide iterative improvement
3. **Document success**: Keep notes on what works well to build your personal hybrid teaching toolkit
4. **Gradual expansion**: Add one new quick win every few sessions rather than changing everything at once
5. **Connect the dimensions**: As you master quick wins in one dimension, look for natural connections to other dimensions
6. **Protect wellbeing**: Ensure your implementation pace is sustainable and prevents burnout
7. **Build community**: Connect with colleagues facing similar challenges for mutual support and idea sharing

Remember that successful hybrid teaching develops through iteration. These quick wins provide starting points that can evolve into more sophisticated implementations as your confidence and capabilities grow.
