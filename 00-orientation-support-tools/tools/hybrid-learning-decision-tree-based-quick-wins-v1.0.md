# Quick Wins Guide
## Based on Your Decision Tree Recommendation

Once you've identified your starting dimension through the Decision Tree, these "quick wins" will help you gain momentum with manageable implementations that demonstrate immediate value.

## Learning Environment & Technology Quick Wins

**Essential Implementation Wins:**
- **Simple Backchannel**: Set up a basic chat tool (like the chat feature in Zoom or Teams) that all students can access during class sessions
- **Camera Positioning**: Adjust your webcam position to ensure clear visibility of both you and any demonstration materials
- **Remote Student View**: Begin each session by checking what remote students can see/hear to ensure basic visibility
- **Troubleshooting Cheat Sheet**: Create a one-page guide for common technical issues that you and students can reference

**Enhanced Implementation Wins:**
- **Dual Display Setup**: Configure a second screen to keep remote students visible throughout the session
- **Simple Polling**: Implement quick polls using built-in features of your video conferencing platform
- **Digital Handouts**: Convert key course materials to digital formats accessible to all participants
- **Tech Buddy System**: Pair on-site and remote students to ensure communication if technical issues arise

## Learning Experience & Assessment Design Quick Wins

**Essential Implementation Wins:**
- **Hybrid-Friendly Instructions**: Revise activity instructions to explicitly address both participation modes
- **Participation Protocols**: Establish simple turn-taking protocols that include remote students
- **Equivalent Submission Options**: Ensure assignment submission methods work equally well for all students
- **Check-In Questions**: Add brief comprehension questions throughout lessons to maintain engagement

**Enhanced Implementation Wins:**
- **Hybrid Think-Pair-Share**: Adapt the think-pair-share technique to include mixed on-site/remote pairs
- **Digital Annotation**: Implement shared annotation of learning materials visible to all students
- **Flexible Assessment Options**: Offer choice in assessment format (written, video, presentation)
- **Parallel Activities**: Design activities with parallel paths for on-site and remote participation

## Student Engagement & Community Quick Wins

**Essential Implementation Wins:**
- **Inclusive Introduction Activities**: Start with name/identity recognition activities that work across modes
- **Regular Check-Ins**: Implement brief check-ins with remote students to ensure they feel included
- **Visual Attention Signals**: Establish simple visual cues to manage attention across participation modes
- **Deliberate Name Use**: Consistently use names when calling on students to maintain presence

**Enhanced Implementation Wins:**
- **Cross-Modal Partners**: Create intentional partnerships between on-site and remote students
- **Digital Discussion Board**: Implement an asynchronous discussion space that extends in-class conversations
- **Community Roles**: Assign rotating roles that distribute responsibility across participation modes
- **Shared Digital Artifacts**: Create collaborative documents where all students contribute

## Implementation Tips

1. **Start small**: Choose 1-2 quick wins from your priority dimension to implement immediately
2. **Seek feedback**: Ask students about their experience with these implementations
3. **Document success**: Keep notes on what works well to build your hybrid teaching toolkit
4. **Gradual expansion**: Add one new quick win every few sessions rather than changing everything at once
5. **Connect the dimensions**: As you master quick wins in one dimension, look for natural connections to other dimensions

Remember that successful hybrid teaching develops through iteration. These quick wins provide starting points that can evolve into more sophisticated implementations as your confidence grows.
