# Decision Tree for Starting Dimension
## A Strategic Tool for Prioritizing Your Hybrid Teaching Journey

### Introduction

The Decision Tree for Starting Dimension is a practical navigation tool designed to help educators identify the most strategic entry point into hybrid teaching implementation. Based on research showing that attempting to transform all aspects of teaching simultaneously can lead to cognitive overload and implementation failure (Handayani & Sulastri, 2022), this tool guides you to focus on one dimension initially, building confidence and competence before expanding to others.

This decision support tool helps you:
- Identify your most pressing hybrid teaching challenge
- Connect urgent needs to specific toolkit dimensions
- Determine an appropriate implementation level based on your context
- Access targeted quick wins for immediate progress
- Create a sustainable development pathway

### How to Use This Tool

1. **Start with honest reflection** about your current hybrid teaching challenges
2. **Follow the decision path** that best matches your situation
3. **Note your recommended starting dimension** and implementation level
4. **Access the corresponding Quick Wins Guide** for immediate actions
5. **Use your chosen dimension's toolkit components** to begin implementation

Remember: There's no "wrong" starting point. The best dimension to begin with is the one that addresses your most immediate needs or strongest interests.

**C) "Building community matters most to me"**
- Passionate about student connection
- Want to foster belonging for all
- Focused on social learning

→ **START WITH: Dimension 3** at your Compass-assessed readiness level
- Let your Hybrid Teaching Compass results guide Essential/Enhanced/Transformative choice

## 🎯 Using Your Results

Once you've identified your starting dimension:

1. **Access the corresponding Quick Wins Guide** for immediate implementation ideas
2. **Review the Implementation Level Cards** for your recommended level
3. **Select 2-3 specific quick wins** to implement in your next session
4. **Use the dimension-specific toolkit components** for deeper implementation
5. **Plan to reassess** after 3-4 sessions to consider expanding

### Remember:
- Starting with one dimension doesn't mean ignoring others entirely
- You can implement basic strategies from other dimensions as needed
- The goal is focused improvement rather than overwhelming transformation
- Success in one dimension builds confidence for expanding to others
