## Usage Guidelines

### Integration with Hybrid Teaching Compass

1. Instructors complete the Hybrid Teaching Compass self-assessment
2. Based on results, they receive the appropriate General Implementation Level Card
3. They then reference the corresponding Dimension-Specific Cards when using each toolkit component

### Within Toolkit Components

Each dimension-specific tool in the kit should include:

1. Clear reference to the corresponding Implementation Level Cards
2. Specific guidance for applying each implementation level within that tool
3. Visual indicators matching the card color-coding to mark implementation level-specific elements

### Connection to Technology Mapping Matrix

The Implementation Level Cards directly connect to the Technology Mapping Matrix:

1. Technology requirements specified in the cards align with technology categories in the matrix
2. Implementation examples provide practical applications of technologies from the matrix
3. Success indicators relate to effective technology implementation across dimensions

### Workshop Usage

For professional development workshops:
1. Use cards as sorting activities to identify current practice
2. Provide as take-away reference materials
3. Use as discussion prompts for implementation planning
4. Connect to readiness profiles from the Hybrid Teaching Compass
