# Hybrid Learning and Teaching Reflection Prompts

## Introduction
This guide helps you reflect on your current practices across the three dimensions of the Hybrid Learning Design Toolkit. Take time to consider each prompt thoughtfully before synthesizing your insights.

## Dimension 1: Learning Environment & Technology Design

This dimension focuses on creating unified spaces that seamlessly integrate physical and virtual elements to support effective hybrid learning. Reflect on your capabilities in developing technological infrastructure, configuring physical spaces, and ensuring equitable access across participation modes.

### Reflection Prompts
*Consider these prompts based on research-based frameworks on technology readiness and integration in educational contexts.*

• How familiar are you with the range of technologies needed for effective hybrid teaching?
• How confidently can you select technologies that best support your specific learning goals?
• How would you describe your approach to physical classroom setup for hybrid teaching?
• What strategies do you use to ensure remote and in-person students can equally see and hear each other?
• How do you handle technical problems that arise during hybrid sessions?
• What backup plans do you have in place when technology fails?
• Do you primarily use technology to replicate traditional teaching activities, or to create new types of learning experiences?
• How do you select technologies based on specific learning objectives rather than just availability?
• In what ways does your technology setup enable teaching methods that wouldn't be possible otherwise?
• How do your technology choices affect the types of learning activities students can engage in?

### Synthesizing Your Reflections
Review your responses to the reflection prompts above. Consider these key aspects of your practice:

- The **range and sophistication** of technologies you confidently use
- Your **approach to technology integration** (replicating vs. transforming teaching)
- The **intentionality** of your physical-virtual space design
- Your **technical troubleshooting** capacity and contingency planning
- The **pedagogical alignment** of your technology choices with learning goals
- How your technology enables or constrains **specific teaching approaches**

## Dimension 2: Learning Experience & Assessment Design

This dimension addresses the pedagogical aspects of hybrid learning, encompassing learning design, instructional activities, teaching strategies, and aligned assessment methods. It focuses on creating learning experiences that are equally effective for both on-site and remote students while leveraging the unique affordances of hybrid environments.

### Reflection Prompts
*Consider these prompts based on research on learning design, constructive alignment, and assessment in hybrid contexts.*

• How do you adapt your learning objectives and outcomes for hybrid contexts?
• What approaches do you use to design learning activities that work across participation modes?
• How do you balance structure and flexibility in your hybrid course design?
• What strategies do you use to manage cognitive load for students in hybrid environments?
• How do you ensure assessments are equitable for students regardless of participation mode?
• In what ways do you incorporate formative feedback mechanisms across modalities?
• How do you leverage the unique affordances of hybrid environments in your learning design?
• To what extent do your learning activities encourage interaction between on-site and remote students?
• How do you design alternative pathways that accommodate student choices in participation mode?
• How does your assessment approach align with the hybrid nature of the learning experience?

### Synthesizing Your Reflections
Review your responses to the reflection prompts above. Consider these key aspects of your practice:

- The **alignment** between learning outcomes, activities, and assessments in hybrid contexts
- Your approach to **activity design** for multi-modal engagement
- The **balance of structure and flexibility** in your hybrid learning design
- How you manage **cognitive load and attention** in hybrid learning experiences
- Your **assessment strategies** for ensuring equity across participation modes
- How you incorporate **formative feedback** in hybrid contexts
- The extent to which you design **flexible pathways** for diverse learner needs

## Dimension 3: Facilitation, Equity & Community Design

This dimension focuses on implementing effective facilitation strategies, ensuring equitable participation, and building community across physical-virtual boundaries. It addresses the social and emotional aspects of learning that are particularly challenging in hybrid contexts where students may experience different forms of presence and belonging based on their participation mode.

### Reflection Prompts
*Consider these prompts based on research on facilitation, inclusion, and community building in hybrid learning environments.*

• How do you ensure equitable attention and engagement between in-person and remote students?
• What strategies do you use to facilitate discussions that bridge the physical-virtual divide?
• How do you cultivate a sense of community among all participants regardless of location?
• What approaches do you use to monitor and respond to student engagement across modalities?
• How do you help students develop social presence when participating remotely?
• What techniques do you employ to manage your attention between student groups?
• How do you facilitate meaningful interaction between students in different participation modes?
• What strategies do you use to ensure inclusive participation for students who might otherwise be marginalized?
• How do you support students in making effective choices about their participation mode?
• What approaches do you use to address the challenges of group identity and belonging in hybrid contexts?

### Synthesizing Your Reflections
Review your responses to the reflection prompts above. Consider these key aspects of your practice:

- Your strategies for **equitable attention distribution** between student groups
- Your approaches to **facilitating cross-modal interaction** between students
- How you foster **community development** across physical and virtual spaces
- Your techniques for **monitoring and supporting engagement** in all participation modes
- How you address **inclusion and belonging** challenges in hybrid environments
