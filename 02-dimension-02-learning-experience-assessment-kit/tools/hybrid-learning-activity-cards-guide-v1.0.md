# Hybrid Learning Activity Cards Guide

## Purpose and Pedagogical Rationale

The Hybrid Learning Activity Cards represent a comprehensive collection of 26 research-based learning activities specifically designed for hybrid learning environments. Unlike traditional activity resources that focus on single-mode delivery, these cards provide concrete, actionable strategies for creating engaging learning experiences that work effectively for both on-site and remote students participating simultaneously in the same session.

### Why Activity Cards?

The card format addresses a critical gap in hybrid learning support. While educators understand the importance of active learning, many struggle to adapt familiar activities for dual-mode delivery or lack ready-to-implement alternatives to lecture-based approaches. Research by Wagner et al. (2023) and Raes et al. (2020) consistently shows that hybrid learning environments often default to passive instruction when educators lack structured guidance for interactive approaches.

The card system transforms abstract pedagogical principles into concrete tools that educators can immediately implement, reducing the design burden while ensuring research-based effectiveness.

### Theoretical Foundation

The Activity Cards are grounded in multiple complementary frameworks:

**ICAP Framework** (Chi & Wylie, 2014): The cognitive engagement progression from Passive to Active to Constructive to Interactive is systematically operationalized throughout the cards, with the four ICAP levels adapted to three practical engagement categories—Receiving (Passive), Responding (Active), and Creating (Constructive)—that structure the card organization, guide cognitive complexity progression, and ensure meaningful learning progression within each planned learning segment.

**Multiple Instructional Design Frameworks**: The activity purpose categories draw from various established frameworks:
- **Laurillard's Six Learning Types** (Laurillard, 2002): Acquisition, Discussion, Investigation, Practice, Collaboration, Production
- **Gagné's Nine Events of Instruction** (Gagné, 1965): Sequential instructional events that inform activity structure and progression
- **Bloom's Revised Taxonomy** (Anderson et al., 2001): Hierarchical cognitive levels that guide activity complexity
- **Learning Design Methodologies** (Young & Perović, 2016; Salmon & Wright, 2014): Rapid design approaches including ABC Learning Design and Carpe Diem

These multiple frameworks ensure pedagogical variety and balanced learning experiences across different ways of engaging with content and developing understanding.

**Community of Inquiry Framework** (Garrison, Anderson & Archer, 2000): The three foundational "presences"—teaching presence, social presence, and cognitive presence—are specifically operationalized within the cards to address documented hybrid learning challenges. Teaching presence is structured through implementation guidance and attention management strategies, addressing what Raes et al. (2020) identified as the "hyper-focus" challenge of managing dual environments. Social presence is fostered through dedicated cards targeting peer connection and the "Hybrid Considerations" sections that plan cross-modal interaction, directly addressing Wagner et al.'s (2023) findings on engagement disparities between remote and on-site students. Cognitive presence is systematically developed through the engagement level progression and evidence-based activity designs that ensure deep learning occurs equivalently across participation modes.

**Empirical Hybrid Learning Research**: Specific findings from key studies (Raes et al., 2020; Wagner et al., 2023; Zydney et al., 2019; Bower et al., 2015) are operationalized in each card's "Hybrid Considerations" sections, addressing documented challenges like engagement disparities, technical infrastructure issues, and cognitive load management.
