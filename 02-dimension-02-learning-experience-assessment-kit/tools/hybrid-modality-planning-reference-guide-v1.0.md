*A quick guide for completing modality columns in hybrid learning planning tools*

## For Activity Sequence Canvas: "Modality Adjustments" Column

### Remote Students
- **Access:** How will they access materials and see/hear instruction clearly? *(e.g., downloadable resources, multiple camera angles, transcripts)*
- **Participation:** What channels/methods will they use to engage and contribute? *(e.g., chat responses, digital hand-raising, collaborative documents)*
- **Visibility:** How will their presence be acknowledged in the physical space? *(e.g., display on large screen, calling on remote students first, audio alerts)*
- **Technology:** What specific tools or platforms do they need? *(e.g., stable video connection, digital annotation tools, breakout rooms)*
- **Support:** What additional guidance or resources will they need? *(e.g., pre-session tech check, simplified navigation paths, designated help channel)*

### On-site Students
- **Connection:** How will they interact with remote peers effectively? *(e.g., facing camera when speaking, shared digital workspace, cross-modal partners)*
- **Technology:** How might technology used for remote students affect their experience? *(e.g., wearing headsets, viewing shared screens, managing audio feedback)*
- **Space:** What physical arrangement supports hybrid interaction? *(e.g., U-shaped seating, visible monitors, designated collaboration zones)*
- **Attention:** How will they maintain awareness of remote participants? *(e.g., camera indicators, audio cues, facilitator reminders)*
- **Sharing:** How will they share physical resources/artifacts with remote peers? *(e.g., document camera, photos uploaded to shared space, verbal descriptions)*

## Extended Modality Considerations

### For Remote Students
- **Outcome Achievement:** Can they achieve the learning outcomes equally well remotely? *(e.g., alternative ways to demonstrate field-based skills, different formats for similar outcomes)*
- **Evidence Generation:** How will they demonstrate their learning? *(e.g., digital portfolios, recorded presentations, online exam formats)*
- **Long-term Engagement:** What might affect their engagement throughout the course? *(e.g., sense of community, access to group work, visibility in discussions)*
- **Resource Access:** Do they have equitable access to all needed resources? *(e.g., digital library materials, software licenses, alternative lab experiences)*
- **Assessment Equity:** Are assessment approaches fair across modalities? *(e.g., equivalent time constraints, access to support, alternative formats)*

### For On-site Students
- **Modality Effects:** How does the hybrid format affect their learning experience? *(e.g., pace changes for technology use, different discussion dynamics)*
- **Physical Advantages:** What benefits from physical presence should be leveraged? *(e.g., hands-on activities, immediate feedback, spontaneous discussions)*
- **Potential Distractions:** What might distract from effective learning? *(e.g., technical setup time, divided attention from screens, audio interference)*
- **Technology Integration:** How will technology integration affect their experience? *(e.g., new skills needed, workflow changes, classroom arrangement)*
- **Cross-modal Interaction:** What skills do they need for effective collaboration? *(e.g., clear articulation for microphones, digital collaboration etiquette, patience with delays)*

## Implementation Level Indicators

| Element | Essential | Enhanced | Transformative |
|---------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| **Content Access** | Same content in different formats *(PDFs for all)* | Parallel resources optimized by modality *(interactive online vs. hands-on)* | Adaptive content responding to context *(AI-recommended resources)* |
| **Participation** | Basic participation channels *(raise hand feature)* | Balanced protocols across modalities *(structured turn-taking)* | Seamless cross-modal participation *(immersive shared spaces)* |
| **Interaction** | Basic cross-modal communication *(video + chat)* | Structured cross-modal activities *(facilitated groups)* | Persistent collaborative spaces *(24/7 hybrid workspaces)* |
| **Technology** | Basic connection platforms *(Zoom, Teams)* | Strategic tool integration *(specialized apps for tasks)* | Immersive physical-digital ecosystem *(VR/AR integration)* |
| **Assessment** | Equivalent submission options *(paper or digital)* | Parallel assessment approaches *(modality-specific methods)* | Integrated assessment ecosystem *(continuous multi-modal evidence)* |
