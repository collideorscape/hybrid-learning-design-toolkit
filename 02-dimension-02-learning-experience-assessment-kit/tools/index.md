# üé¥ Tools

Essential planning, design, and assessment tools for creating engaging hybrid learning experiences that progress through cognitive engagement levels.

## üìä Planning Tools

### [Activity Sequence Canvas Usage Guide](hybrid-activity-sequence-canvas-usage-guide)
Large-format planning template for organizing learning segments with engagement progression. Aligns activities, assessments, and modality adaptations across session/module/course scales.

**Use when:** Planning any hybrid learning sequence  
**Grounded in:** ICAP framework and constructive alignment principles

## üé¥ Activity Design Cards

### [Activity Strategy Cards Complete](hybrid-learning-activity-cards-complete-v1.0)
26 research-based activity patterns color-coded by engagement level (Receiving, Responding, Creating) with hybrid implementation guidance, time estimates, and tech requirements.

**Best for:** Selecting and sequencing learning activities  
**Includes:** [How to Use Guide](hybrid-learning-activity-cards-guide-v1.0)

## üìù Assessment Resources

### [Assessment Method Cards Complete](hybrid-learning-assessment-cards-complete-v1.0)
14 assessment strategies for hybrid contexts including formative, summative, and dual-purpose options with equity considerations and technology requirements.

**Best for:** Designing fair assessment across modalities  
**Includes:** [How to Use Guide](hybrid-learning-assessment-cards-guide-v1.0)

## üìã Planning & Adaptation Guides

### [Hybrid Adaptation Planning Worksheet](hybrid-adaptation-planning-worksheet-v1.0)
**Side 1:** Side-by-side experience mapping for on-site and remote students across five key dimensions  
**Side 2:** Cognitive load analysis, participation equity strategies, and implementation planning

**Use when:** Ensuring equivalent experiences across modalities

### [Modality Planning Reference Guide](hybrid-modality-planning-reference-guide-v1.0)
Quick decision-making support with decision trees for modality selection, technology integration guidelines, and participation equity protocols.

**Best for:** In-the-moment planning decisions and troubleshooting

## How to Use These Tools

1. **Start with Planning** to map your learning sequence
   - Use the **Activity Sequence Canvas** to organize cognitive progression
   - Identify engagement levels needed for your learning goals

2. **Select Activities** based on pedagogical intent
   - Browse **Activity Strategy Cards** by engagement level
   - Choose activities that build from Receiving ‚Üí Responding ‚Üí Creating

3. **Align Assessment** with learning activities
   - Select **Assessment Method Cards** that match your activities
   - Ensure fair evaluation across all participation modes

4. **Ensure Equity** across modalities
   - Complete the **Adaptation Planning Worksheet** for key activities
   - Use the **Reference Guide** for quick equity checks

5. **Iterate and improve** based on student feedback and outcomes

## üöÄ Quick Start Sequence

1. **Plan with the Canvas** - Map out your learning sequence
2. **Select Activity Cards** - Choose activities for each segment  
3. **Align Assessment Cards** - Match assessment to activities
4. **Adapt for Equity** - Use planning guides to ensure equivalent experiences

## üí° Design Tips

- **Start with learning objectives**, not available activities
- **Progress through engagement levels** within each session
- **Mix individual and collaborative** activities
- **Provide multiple assessment options** for equity
- **Test your sequence** with timing estimates

## üìä Activity Distribution Guide

For a balanced learning experience:
- 20-30% Receiving activities (foundation building)
- 40-50% Responding activities (active practice)  
- 20-30% Creating activities (knowledge construction)
