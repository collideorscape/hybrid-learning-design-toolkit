## Cognitive Load Analysis

Rate the anticipated cognitive load for students in each modality, then develop strategies to balance and manage these demands.

| Cognitive Load Factor | On-site Students | Remote Students | Mitigation Strategy |
|------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Navigation complexity** <br>*Finding, accessing, and moving between resources* | ◯ Low<br>◯ Medium<br>◯ High | ◯ Low<br>◯ Medium<br>◯ High | |
| **Technical management** <br>*Operating tools and platforms* | ◯ Low<br>◯ Medium<br>◯ High | ◯ Low<br>◯ Medium<br>◯ High | |
| **Multitasking demands** <br>*Handling multiple streams or tasks* | ◯ Low<br>◯ Medium<br>◯ High | ◯ Low<br>◯ Medium<br>◯ High | |
| **Social coordination** <br>*Managing interactions with others* | ◯ Low<br>◯ Medium<br>◯ High | ◯ Low<br>◯ Medium<br>◯ High | |

**Overall Cognitive Load Assessment:**
- On-site Students: ◯ Low  ◯ Medium  ◯ High
- Remote Students: ◯ Low  ◯ Medium  ◯ High

**Adjustments needed to balance cognitive load:**

## Resource Requirements

Identify the specific resources needed for successful implementation in both modalities.

| Resource Category | On-site Requirements | Remote Requirements | Preparation Notes |
|-------------------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Technology platforms** | *e.g., LMS, video conferencing* | *e.g., video conferencing with breakout rooms* | |
| **Digital tools/software** | *e.g., collaborative whiteboard, polling tools* | *e.g., annotation tools, digital workspace* | |
| **Physical materials** | *e.g., handouts, manipulatives, equipment* | *e.g., printable resources, home kits if applicable* | |
| **Human support needed** | *e.g., in-room facilitator, tech support* | *e.g., virtual producer, remote assistant* | |

## Participation Equity Planning

### Balanced Participation Strategies

| Participation Format | On-site Approach | Remote Approach | Balancing Strategy |
|---------------------|------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| **Verbal contributions** | *e.g., microphone passing, structured turns* | *e.g., raise hand feature, designated speaking time* | *e.g., alternate between remote and on-site speakers* |
| **Text-based contributions** | *e.g., shared physical whiteboard or chart paper* | *e.g., chat, collaborative document* | *e.g., display digital contributions in physical space* |
| **Visual contributions** | *e.g., physical demonstrations, sketches* | *e.g., screen sharing, digital annotation* | *e.g., document camera for physical artifacts* |
| **Collaborative activities** | *e.g., table group discussions, hands-on tasks* | *e.g., breakout rooms, digital workspaces* | *e.g., paired on-site/remote groups with liaisons* |

**Equity Considerations:** Remember that balanced participation requires intentional design, not just equal opportunity. Consider designating specific roles that leverage the strengths of each modality (e.g., digital documenters for remote students, physical space arrangers for on-site students). Monitor participation patterns and be prepared to adjust your approach if you notice imbalances developing.

## Activity Adaptation by Engagement Level

| Engagement Level | Common Challenges | Key Adaptation Strategies |
|------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| **Receiving (Passive)** | • Remote students may have difficulty maintaining attention<br>• On-site students may forget about remote participants<br>• Screen visibility may be limited for complex visual content | 1. Add periodic engagement prompts specific to each modality<br>2. Use digital content that all students can access equally<br>3. Check comprehension using equivalent methods for both groups |
| **Responding (Active)** | • Response mechanisms may differ across modalities<br>• Timing of responses may be unbalanced<br>• Technical delays may impact equal participation | 1. Create clear turn-taking or response protocols<br>2. Use parallel response channels (verbal for on-site, chat for remote)<br>3. Design activities with flexible timing to accommodate technical delays |
| **Creating (Constructive)** | • Collaboration tools may function differently across modalities<br>• Creative processes may be harder to facilitate remotely<br>• Sharing created artifacts may be more challenging across modes | 1. Select creation tools accessible to all participants<br>2. Structure the creative process with clear roles and expectations<br>3. Plan for multimodal sharing of created artifacts |

## Quick Implementation Tips by Activity Type

| Activity Type | Key Consideration | Tech Recommendation | Common Pitfall | Quick Tip |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Discussion** | Equal voice opportunity | Digital hand-raising | Remote students speaking last | Alternate starting location |
| **Demonstration** | Visibility for all | Multiple camera angles | Assuming all can see details | Verbalize physical actions |
| **Group Work** | Cross-modal connection | Shared digital workspaces | In-person only groups | Designate digital connectors |
| **Practice** | Feedback equivalence | Digital submission tools | Delayed remote feedback | Set up peer feedback |
| **Presentation** | Audience connection | Dual displays | Focus on one modality | Practice with hybrid audience |
