# Activity Sequence Canvas Guide

## Purpose and Pedagogical Rationale

The Activity Sequence Canvas serves as the central planning tool in the Hybrid Learning Activity Designer toolkit, providing a structured yet flexible framework for designing learning experiences that work effectively across physical and virtual spaces simultaneously. Unlike traditional lesson planning templates that focus on single-mode delivery, this canvas specifically addresses the unique challenges and opportunities of hybrid learning environments where students participate both in-person and remotely in the same session.

### Why This Canvas Structure?

The canvas design is grounded in cognitive engagement research (Chi & Wylie, 2014) and hybrid learning best practices (Raes et al., 2020; Zydney et al., 2019). It addresses three critical design challenges identified in hybrid learning research:

1. **Engagement Progression**: Moving students systematically through increasing levels of cognitive engagement rather than defaulting to passive lecture formats
2. **Modality Equity**: Ensuring equivalent learning opportunities for both remote and on-site participants
3. **Temporal Structure**: Organizing learning experiences across time in ways that maintain momentum and coherence

The canvas transforms abstract pedagogical principles into concrete planning spaces, making theoretical frameworks actionable for busy educators.

## Canvas Structure Explained

### Header Section: Course Context

**Course Title** - Identifies the specific course or learning context
**Designer(s)** - Documents who created the learning experience for collaboration and accountability

### Implementation Level Indicator

A visual slider representing the three implementation approaches:
- **Essential**: Basic adaptation of existing practices for hybrid delivery
- **Enhanced**: Strategic redesign leveraging hybrid-specific capabilities  
- **Transformative**: Innovative approaches unique to hybrid contexts

This indicator helps educators set appropriate expectations and select matching activity complexity levels.

### Learning Goals Section

An open planning space for documenting intended learning outcomes using any preferred methodology (learning objectives, essential questions, competencies, etc.). The canvas deliberately avoids prescribing specific outcome formats to accommodate diverse pedagogical approaches while ensuring learning intention clarity.

### Scale Selection

Flexible temporal framing allowing educators to plan at different levels:
- **Session Scale**: Individual class periods measured in minutes
- **Module Scale**: Multi-session sequences measured in days/weeks  
- **Course Scale**: Semester-long progressions measured in weeks/months
- **Custom Scale**: User-defined temporal units for specialized contexts

### Main Planning Grid

The core of the canvas organized as a matrix with two key dimensions:

#### Vertical Dimension: Engagement Levels
Based on the ICAP Framework (Chi & Wylie, 2014), adapted for practical application:

**RECEIVING (Passive)**
- Students absorb information through instructor presentation, multimedia, or demonstrations
- Examples: lectures, videos, live demonstrations
- Cognitive demand: Basic attention and comprehension

**RESPONDING (Active)**  
- Students actively engage with content through questions, discussions, and structured activities
- Examples: Q&A, polls, discussions, case analysis
- Cognitive demand: Application of knowledge and active participation

**CREATING (Constructive)**
- Students generate new understanding through production, synthesis, and original work
- Examples: projects, presentations, problem-solving, design challenges
- Cognitive demand: Knowledge construction and creative application

#### Horizontal Dimension: Learning Segments
Flexible time-based divisions allowing educators to structure learning progression:
- Each segment represents a distinct phase of the learning experience
- Duration is flexible based on selected scale (minutes for sessions, days for modules, etc.)
- Default of 3 segments with ability to add or remove based on learning design needs

#### Grid Cells: Activity Planning Spaces
Each intersection of engagement level and learning segment contains:

**Card Placement Area**: Space for positioning Activity Cards from the 26-card deck
**Activity Details**: Notes section for timing, materials, technology requirements, and specific adaptations

### Modality Adjustments Row

A dedicated planning space addressing the core challenge of hybrid learning: ensuring equivalent experiences across participation modes.

**For Remote Students**: Specific strategies for technology, participation, visibility, and support
**For On-Site Students**: Adaptations for connecting with remote peers, managing technology integration, and maintaining inclusive dynamics

This row operationalizes findings from Wagner et al. (2023) and Bower et al. (2015) about the critical importance of intentional modality planning.

## Integration with Other Toolkit Components

### Activity Cards
The 26 Activity Cards are designed to be physically placed on the canvas grid cells. Each card provides:
- Implementation guidance specific to hybrid contexts
- Technology requirements and suggestions
- Timing estimates
- Hybrid-specific considerations

Cards are color-coded by engagement level (blue for Receiving, green for Responding, orange for Creating) to support visual organization on the canvas.

### Assessment Method Cards  
The 14 Assessment Cards can be used alongside the canvas to plan evaluation strategies that align with learning activities and work effectively across modalities.

### Hybrid Adaptation Planning Worksheet
The Hybrid Adaptation Planning Worksheet provides in-depth planning for modality adjustments that feed into the Modality Adjustments row of the canvas. This double-sided planning tool helps you ensure that both remote and on-site students have equivalent (though not necessarily identical) learning experiences.

### Modality Planning Reference Guide
The Modality Planning Reference Guide offers quick guidance on what to include in the Modality Adjustments row. It provides a structured approach to considering both remote and on-site students' needs.

## Scale Flexibility and Adaptation

## Theoretical Foundations

### ICAP Framework Application
The vertical organization directly implements Chi and Wylie's (2014) cognitive engagement hierarchy, providing educators with a research-based structure for planning increasingly complex learning activities.

### Multiple Instructional Design Integration
The canvas structure incorporates insights from various frameworks:
- **Gagné's Nine Events of Instruction** (Gagné, 1965): Systematic activity sequencing from attention through retention
- **Bloom's Revised Taxonomy** (Anderson et al., 2001): Cognitive progression guiding activity complexity
- **Merrill's First Principles** (Merrill, 2002): Problem-centered approach informing activity design
- **Constructive Alignment** (Biggs, 1996): Ensuring activities align with intended outcomes through the Learning Goals section

### Hybrid Learning Research Integration
The Modality Adjustments row specifically addresses challenges identified by:
- **Raes et al. (2020)**: Technical infrastructure and engagement disparities
- **Wagner et al. (2023)**: Social presence and participation equity  
- **Zydney et al. (2019)**: Attention management and facilitation strategies
- **Bower et al. (2015)**: Design factors for effective blended synchronous learning

### Community of Inquiry Framework
The canvas structure supports all three presences:
- **Teaching Presence**: Through systematic activity planning and modality guidance
- **Social Presence**: Via peer interaction activities and cross-modal connection strategies  
- **Cognitive Presence**: Through engagement level progression and learning goal alignment

## Practical Implementation Guidance

### Getting Started
**For New Hybrid Instructors**: Start with Essential implementation level and focus on adapting 2-3 familiar activities using the Activity Cards as guides.
