# Dimension 2: Learning Experience & Assessment Design Kit

How do we create activities and assessments that engage all students equally, whether they're in the classroom or joining from across the world?
This dimension addresses the pedagogical redesign necessary for effective hybrid teaching.

Drawing on multiple instructional design traditions, learning design methodologies, and empirical hybrid research (including Laurillard's six learning types, ABC Learning Design rapid prototyping, ICAP cognitive engagement framework, and studies documenting engagement disparities), these tools support systematic activity design that ensures equivalent opportunities regardless of location.

## How These Tools Work Together

These tools form a coordinated system for designing engaging hybrid learning experiences. Rather than working in isolation, they connect to create a comprehensive approach to pedagogical design and learning experience analysis:

>#### Key Connections
>- **Sequence Canvas ‚Üí Activity Cards**: The canvas provides structure for placing specific activity patterns from the cards
>- **Activity Cards ‚Üí Assessment Cards**: Activity choices inform appropriate assessment strategies for each engagement level
>- **Learning Activity Adapter ‚Üí Modality Companion**: Detailed activity adaptation informs quick modality decisions
>- **All Tools ‚Üí Sequence Canvas**: Everything connects back to the central planning template

## Where to start

This dimension offers multiple entry points depending on your pedagogical experience and immediate needs. Whether you're redesigning a course from scratch, adapting existing activities for hybrid delivery, or troubleshooting engagement issues, the tools can be combined strategically. Below are recommended **workflows for different scenarios** to help you navigate these resources effectively.

{: .note }
>### **üéØ First-Time Hybrid Design Path**
>1. **Start with Activity Sequence Canvas** - Map one learning session with basic Receiving ‚Üí Responding progression
>2. **Use Activity Strategy Cards** - Select 3-5 cards focusing on blue (Receiving) and green (Responding) levels
>3. **Add Assessment Method Cards** - Choose assessment cards for alignment
>4. **Use Modality Companion** - Make quick modality decisions for each Canvas activity

>### **üö® Emergency Hybrid Pivot Path** (when you need to adapt existing content immediately)
>1. **Modality Companion for Canvas** - Quick guidance for adapting your current activities
>2. **Activity Sequence Canvas** - Map existing content into hybrid-friendly structure
>3. **Activity Strategy Cards** - Find hybrid alternatives for activities that don't translate well
>4. **Assessment Method Cards** - Identify equitable assessment options for your context

{: .note }
>### **üîÑ Engagement Improvement Path**
>1. **Use Activity Strategy Cards** to identify more engaging alternatives to lecture-heavy sessions
>2. **Apply Learning Activity Adapter** to redesign activities that aren't working well for remote students
>3. **Redesign with Activity Sequence Canvas** incorporating more orange (Creating) level activities
>4. **Update assessment approaches** using Assessment Method Cards aligned to new engagement levels

## Research Foundation

This dimension emerges from a critical insight in hybrid learning research: even perfect technology fails without intentional pedagogical redesign. Post-pandemic studies reveal that simply streaming traditional classroom activities online creates what Wagner et al. (2023) call "second-class" experiences for remote students, with consistently lower engagement and participation rates.

The breakthrough comes from understanding that effective hybrid learning requires "equivalency" rather than identical experiences‚Äîequivalent opportunities for engagement, learning, and demonstration of knowledge across modalities. This insight reshapes everything from activity selection to assessment design.

Our approach synthesizes multiple instructional design traditions into practical tools. The ICAP framework (Chi & Wylie, 2014) provides the engagement progression that structures all planning: moving systematically from Receiving (passive) through Responding (active) to Creating (constructive) engagement. This isn't just theoretical‚Äîresearch consistently shows that remote students benefit disproportionately from higher engagement levels.

The toolkit operationalizes multiple design methodologies and frameworks ‚Äî all adapted specifically for hybrid contexts and through the lenses of User Experience design common practices. Drawing from both established methodologies and emerging hybrid learning research, these tools help create learning experiences that leverage the unique affordances of hybrid environments while ensuring equitable participation opportunities. The tools enable instructors to design purposeful learning sequences that maintain engagement and effectiveness across physical and virtual spaces.
