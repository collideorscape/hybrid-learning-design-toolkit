# ðŸ“– Learning Experience & Assessment Design Kit

Design engaging learning activities and assessments that work seamlessly across physical and virtual spaces.

## ðŸ’¡ The Core Challenge

Even with perfect technology and environments (Dimension 1), hybrid learning fails without intentionally designed learning experiences. The central question: **How do we create learning activities and assessments that engage all students equally, regardless of whether they're sitting in the classroom or joining from across the world?** This dimension addresses the pedagogical redesign necessary for effective hybrid teaching.
