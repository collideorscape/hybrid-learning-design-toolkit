# Activity Sequence Canvas

## Overview
Effective hybrid learning requires systematic sequencing of activities that engage students across participation modes while maintaining pedagogical coherence. The Hybrid Learning Activity Sequence Canvas provides a large-format visual planning framework for organizing learning segments with intentional engagement progression, ensuring all students have equivalent opportunities to participate and contribute regardless of their location.

## Purpose
The Activity Sequence Canvas serves as the central planning tool for Dimension 2, enabling educators to:

- Design learning sequences that balance cognitive engagement levels (receiving, responding, creating)
- Plan smooth transitions between activities that work across modalities
- Align assessment strategies with learning activities and engagement goals
- Map technology requirements and modality adaptations for each segment
- Ensure equitable participation opportunities for on-site and remote students
- Create coherent learning narratives that span session, module, or course timeframes
- Visualize cognitive load distribution and participation patterns

## How It Works

The canvas provides a structured timeline framework with dedicated spaces for activity details, engagement levels, assessment alignment, and modality considerations. Each learning segment includes activity type, duration, technology needs, and adaptation notes. Color-coded engagement indicators (blue for receiving, green for responding, orange for creating) help visualize cognitive progression. Integration points show how activities connect and build toward learning objectives while maintaining equity across participation modes.
