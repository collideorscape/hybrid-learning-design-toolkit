## Overview
Choosing the right learning activity for hybrid contexts requires understanding both pedagogical purpose and technical feasibility across participation modes. The Hybrid Learning Activity Strategy Cards provide a curated collection of 26 research-based activity patterns organized by cognitive engagement level, each with specific guidance for hybrid implementation, technology requirements, and equity considerations.

## Purpose
The Activity Strategy Cards serve as a practical activity selection resource, enabling educators to:

- Select activities based on desired cognitive engagement levels (receiving, responding, creating)
- Access hybrid-specific implementation guidance for each activity type
- Understand technology requirements and alternative options for each activity
- Plan for equitable participation across on-site and remote students
- Estimate time requirements and preparation needs for each activity
- Combine activities strategically to create balanced learning sequences
- Adapt traditional activities for effective hybrid delivery

## How It Works

The cards are organized in three color-coded categories: Receiving activities (blue) for information consumption, Responding activities (green) for active engagement with content, and Creating activities (orange) for knowledge construction and synthesis. Each card provides implementation steps, hybrid considerations, technology requirements, time estimates, and suggestions for combination with other activities. The system supports different implementation levels (Essential, Enhanced, Transformative) allowing educators to match activities to their context and capabilities.
