# Hybrid Learning Adaptation Planning Worksheet

## Overview
Ensuring equitable learning experiences across participation modes requires systematic analysis of how activities and assessments work differently for on-site and remote students. The Hybrid Learning Adaptation Planning Worksheet provides a structured framework for side-by-side experience mapping, cognitive load analysis, and participation equity planning to identify and address potential disparities before they impact learning.

## Purpose
The Adaptation Planning Worksheet serves as a systematic equity analysis tool, enabling educators to:

- Map learning experiences side-by-side for on-site and remote participants
- Identify potential cognitive load differences across participation modes
- Plan specific adaptations to ensure equivalent learning opportunities
- Analyze accessibility requirements for diverse student contexts
- Design participation protocols that engage all students meaningfully
- Anticipate and address technology-related barriers before implementation
- Create contingency plans for common hybrid teaching challenges

## How It Works

The worksheet provides a structured comparison framework with dedicated sections for experience mapping, cognitive load analysis, and equity considerations. Side 1 focuses on activity-by-activity mapping of on-site versus remote experiences, including access, participation, interaction, and assessment opportunities. Side 2 addresses cognitive load factors, participation protocols, technology requirements, and specific adaptations needed to ensure equivalent experiences. The tool includes prompts for identifying potential barriers and planning inclusive alternatives that support all learners effectively.
