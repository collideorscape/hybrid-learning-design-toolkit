## Purpose
The Assessment Method Cards serve as a strategic assessment planning resource, enabling educators to:

- Select assessment approaches that work equitably across participation modes
- Align assessment strategies with specific engagement levels and learning activities
- Design formative feedback mechanisms that support all students effectively
- Create summative assessments that leverage hybrid environment strengths
- Address academic integrity concerns while maintaining authentic assessment
- Plan assessment workflows that account for technology constraints and opportunities
- Ensure assessment accessibility for diverse student contexts and needs

## How It Works

The cards are organized by assessment purpose: Formative cards (üß©) for ongoing feedback and learning support, Summative cards (üèÜ) for evaluation and credentialing, and Dual-Purpose cards (‚ö°) that serve both functions effectively. Each card provides implementation guidance, technology requirements, equity considerations, time estimates, and connections to specific activity types. The system includes scaffolding for different implementation levels and guidance for addressing common hybrid assessment challenges like participation verification and authentic engagement.
