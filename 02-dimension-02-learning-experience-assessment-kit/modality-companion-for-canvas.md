## Overview
When building your Activity Sequence Canvas, you need quick, reliable guidance for modality decisions. The Modality Companion for the Canvas provides instant access to decision frameworks and implementation checklists that help you choose the right approach for each Canvas activity—ensuring equitable experiences whether students are attending remotely, on-site, or switching between modalities.

## Purpose
The Modality Companion serves as your Canvas-building assistant, enabling you to:

- Make quick, informed decisions about synchronous vs. asynchronous approaches
- Choose appropriate technology setups for each Canvas activity
- Ensure participation equity across modalities without deep analysis
- Identify potential barriers before they impact implementation  
- Align modality choices with pedagogical goals for each activity segment
- Create seamless transitions between different participation modes
- Match implementation complexity to your context and capabilities

## How It Works
This companion tool provides structured decision support optimized for Canvas creation workflow. Quick reference sections help you rapidly assess access, participation, visibility, and technology considerations for each activity you're planning. Implementation level indicators guide complexity choices, while modality comparison charts show the strengths and limitations of each approach. Use it as a desktop reference while building your Canvas to ensure every activity works effectively across participation modes.
