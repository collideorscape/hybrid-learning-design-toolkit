# Hybrid Learning Design Toolkit

A comprehensive, research-based toolkit for designing effective hybrid learning experiences that work equitably across physical and virtual spaces.

## 🎯 Overview

The Hybrid Learning Design Toolkit provides educators with practical, evidence-based tools to create engaging hybrid learning environments. Drawing from learning design research, instructional design frameworks, and post-pandemic hybrid teaching insights, this toolkit addresses three essential dimensions of hybrid education:

- **🔧 Dimension 1**: Environment & Technology - Creating integrated learning spaces
- **🎯 Dimension 2**: Learning Experience & Assessment - Designing engaging activities and assessments  
- **🤝 Dimension 3**: Facilitation, Equity & Community - Building human connection across modalities
