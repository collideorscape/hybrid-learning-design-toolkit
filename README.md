# Hybrid Learning Design Toolkit

A comprehensive, research-based toolkit for designing effective hybrid learning experiences that work equitably across physical and virtual spaces.

## 🎯 Overview

The Hybrid Learning Design Toolkit provides educators with practical, evidence-based tools to create engaging hybrid learning environments. Drawing from learning design research, instructional design frameworks, and post-pandemic hybrid teaching insights, this toolkit addresses three essential dimensions of hybrid education:

- **🔧 Dimension 1**: Environment & Technology - Creating integrated learning spaces
- **🎯 Dimension 2**: Learning Experience & Assessment - Designing engaging activities and assessments  
- **🤝 Dimension 3**: Facilitation, Equity & Community - Building human connection across modalities

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Live Demo
Visit the toolkit: **[https://imaginary-institute.github.io/hybrid-learning-design-toolkit](https://imaginary-institute.github.io/hybrid-learning-design-toolkit)**

### Getting Started
1. **Take the Self-Assessment** to identify your current readiness level
2. **Use the Decision Tree** to find your best entry point
3. **Explore the dimension** that matches your immediate needs

## 📖 Research Foundation

This toolkit is grounded in empirical research and proven frameworks:

### Key Research Insights
- **Audio quality is the #1 factor** for remote student engagement (Wagner et al., 2023)
- **"Triple presence"** across physical, digital, and remote contexts must be intentionally integrated (Bülow, 2022)
- **Activity-centered design** creates more effective learning environments than technology-first approaches (Goodyear et al., 2021)

### Theoretical Frameworks
- **Activity-Centered Analysis and Design (ACAD)** - Physical-digital integration analysis
- **ICAP Framework** - Engagement progression from Receiving → Responding → Creating
- **Community of Inquiry** - Teaching, social, and cognitive presence in hybrid contexts
- **Universal Design for Learning** - Ensuring environments work for diverse learners
