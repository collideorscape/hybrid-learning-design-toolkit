### AA3: Digital-Physical Mirror ⚡

**FRONT:**
- Timeline color band: Gradient gray
- Course phase icon: Anytime
- Activity name: Digital-Physical Mirror
- Time required: 3 minutes
- Quick activity indicator: ⚡
- Energy level indicator: Energizing
- Brief description: Paired movement activity where remote and on-site partners mirror each other's simple motions. Creates embodied connection across modalities while providing energizing break that reinforces presence and attention.
- Participant suitability: 👥👥 Ideal for: 8-16 participants
- Card reference: AA3

**BACK:**
- **Implementation steps:**
  1. Pair remote with on-site participants
  2. Leader makes slow, simple movements
  3. Partner mirrors as exactly as possible
  4. Switch leader after 45 seconds
  5. Debrief on connection experience

- **Hybrid adaptations:**
  - Ensure cameras show upper body
  - Start with very simple movements
  - Account for video delay in timing

- **Materials/technology needed:**
  - Cameras with good field of view
  - Space for movement
  - Timer for role switches

- **Variations:**
  - **Small groups (<8)**: Whole group mirrors instructor
  - **Large groups (20+)**: Breakout room implementation
  - **Seated version**: Upper body movements only

- **Pairs well with:** C3 (Mixed-Mode Grouping), A3 (Full-Group Refocusing)


### AA4: One-Word Pulse Check ⚡

**FRONT:**
- Timeline color band: Gradient gray

- Brief description: Rapid emotional temperature check where each participant shares one word describing their current state. Creates space for authentic expression while the constraint maintains focus and pace across modalities.
- Participant suitability: ♾️ Scalable (works for any size)
- Card reference: AA4

**BACK:**
- **Implementation steps:**
  1. Prompt: "One word for how you're feeling right now"
  2. Rapid sharing - no explanations
  3. Alternate between modalities or use chat
  4. Acknowledge range without judgment
  5. Adjust session energy if needed

- **Hybrid adaptations:**
  - Large groups use chat simultaneously
  - Small groups use verbal round-robin
  - Display word cloud if time permits

- **Materials/technology needed:**
  - Chat or verbal sharing method
  - Optional: Word cloud generator
  - Timer for large groups

- **Variations:**
  - **Small groups (<10)**: Verbal with brief eye contact
  - **Large groups (30+)**: Chat only with word cloud
  - **Focused version**: One word about specific topic

- **Pairs well with:** P1 (Digital Backchanneling), A5 (Dual-Track Monitoring)


### AA5: Shared Geography ⚡
