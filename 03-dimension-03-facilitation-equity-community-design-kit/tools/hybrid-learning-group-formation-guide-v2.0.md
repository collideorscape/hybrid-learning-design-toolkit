# Group Formation Guide
*Quick reference for forming effective groups in hybrid learning environments*

## Page 1: Decision Framework

### Quick Decision Tree

Start here to determine your grouping approach:

```
What is your PRIMARY need?
    │
    ├─→ SHORT ACTIVITY (single session)
    │   └─→ Random mixing OK? → YES: Random Groups
    │                        → NO: Quick Interest Clusters
    │
    ├─→ PROJECT WORK (2-4 weeks)
    │   └─→ Mixed modalities essential? → YES: Mixed Groups (Protocol A)
    │                                   → NO: Parallel Groups (Protocol B)
    │
    └─→ SEMESTER-LONG TEAMS
        └─→ Deep collaboration needed? → YES: Mixed Groups with roles
                                      → NO: Flexible configurations
```

### Key Considerations

**Before forming groups, assess:**
- [ ] Ratio of remote to on-site students
- [ ] Technology reliability and student access
- [ ] Time zone distribution (for remote students)
- [ ] Prior hybrid collaboration experience
- [ ] Project complexity and duration

### Group Size Quick Reference

| Size | Best For | Hybrid Notes |
|------|----------|--------------|
| **2** | Quick tasks, peer review | Easiest cross-modal pairing |
| **3-4** | Most projects, discussions | Optimal for mixed groups |
| **5-6** | Complex projects | Maximum for effective hybrid work |

### Formation Methods

**For balanced groups, use cards from the main deck:**
- **EW1: Expertise Directory** - Form groups based on complementary skills
- **EW2: Skills Mapping** - Visual skill distribution for balanced teams  
- **EW3: Group Identity Builder** - Post-formation bonding activity
- **EW4: Study Buddy Matching** - For pairs or initial partnerships
- **EW5: Chain Reaction Formation** - Dynamic mixed-modality formation

## Page 2: Essential Protocols

### Protocol A: Mixed Modality Groups

**When to use:** Project work, community building, skill development

**Basic Setup:**
1. Never isolate single remote students (minimum 2 per group)
2. Appoint rotating "Bridge Builder" role (connects modalities)
3. All members join digital platform, even if on-site
4. Create shared digital workspace from day one

**Supporting Cards:**
- **C3: Mixed-Mode Grouping** - Detailed facilitation strategies
- **T2: Technology Buddy System** - Pair support across modes
- **P5: Engagement Role Rotation** - Structured roles for equity

### Protocol B: Parallel Groups with Exchange

**When to use:** Limited tech, scheduling challenges, complementary tasks

**Basic Setup:**
1. Form separate remote and on-site groups
2. Create "sister group" partnerships
3. Design interdependent tasks
4. Schedule 2-3 formal exchange points
5. Provide unified submission format

**Supporting Cards:**
- **D4: Distributed Facilitation** - Managing parallel discussions
- **A4: Remote Spotlight Rotation** - Ensuring visibility
- **C2: Shared Experience Creation** - Building connections

### Protocol C: Quick Random Groups

**When to use:** Brief activities, discussions, brainstorming

**Basic Setup:**
1. Pre-assign numbers to ensure modality mix
2. Use breakout rooms or physical zones
3. Provide identical prompts/tasks
4. Keep to 10-15 minute maximum
5. Share outcomes in main space

**Supporting Cards:**
- **P3: Synchronized Engagement Moments** - Quick unified activities
- **A3: Full-Group Refocusing** - Bringing groups back together

### Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

| Issue | Quick Solution | Reference Card |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| Remote isolation | Implement buddy system | T2, AA1 |
| Uneven participation | Add structured roles | P5, D4 |
| Tech failures | Pre-establish backup channels | T3, T4 |
| Scheduling conflicts | Create async touchpoints | C4 |

### Remember

✓ **Start simple** - Basic mixed pairs before complex groups  
✓ **Document everything** - Shared visibility prevents gaps  
✓ **Check in often** - Early intervention prevents issues  
✓ **Reference the card deck** - Don't reinvent solutions
