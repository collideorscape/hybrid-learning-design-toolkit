# Hybrid Presence Lens: Understanding Presence in Hybrid Learning
*An educational guide to the three types of presence*

## Introduction

In hybrid learning environments, where students participate simultaneously from physical and virtual spaces, the concept of "presence" becomes both more complex and more critical. This guide introduces the three essential types of presence identified in educational research, explains why facilitation is key to cultivating these presences, and shows how the Hybrid Learning Design Toolkit supports presence development across all dimensions.

## The Three Types of Presence

The Community of Inquiry framework (Garrison et al., 2000) was specifically developed to understand learning in computer-mediated environments, introducing the concept of three essential 'presences' needed for effective online education. While drawing on Dewey's educational philosophy, this framework's innovation was identifying how teaching presence, social presence, and cognitive presence must be intentionally cultivated in technology-mediated learning — making it particularly relevant for understanding hybrid environments where these presences must span both physical and virtual spaces.

### 1. Teaching Presence
**Definition**: The design, facilitation, and direction of cognitive and social processes to achieve meaningful learning outcomes.

**In Hybrid Contexts**: Teaching presence must span both physical and virtual spaces simultaneously. This creates unique challenges as instructors navigate what Ørngreen et al. (2015) termed "split attention," potentially diminishing their presence in one or both spaces.

**Key Components**:
- **Design & Organization**: Creating learning experiences that work equitably across modalities
- **Direct Instruction**: Providing clear guidance accessible to all participants
- **Facilitation**: Managing discourse and activities across physical-virtual boundaries

### 2. Social Presence
**Definition**: The ability of participants to identify with the community, communicate purposefully, and develop interpersonal relationships.

**In Hybrid Contexts**: Remote participants often experience diminished social presence, leading to what Romero-Hall & Vicentini (2017) identified as "peripheral participation." Without intentional bridging, two separate communities may emerge.

**Key Components**:
- **Affective Expression**: Sharing emotions and personality across modalities
- **Open Communication**: Creating channels for meaningful exchange
- **Group Cohesion**: Building unified community identity despite physical separation

### 3. Cognitive Presence
**Definition**: The extent to which learners construct and confirm meaning through sustained reflection and discourse.

**In Hybrid Contexts**: Uneven participation patterns can create disparate cognitive experiences, with remote students often experiencing less robust discourse and fewer opportunities for deep inquiry (Raes et al., 2020).

**Key Components**:
- **Triggering Events**: Ensuring all students encounter provocative questions
- **Exploration**: Providing equitable opportunities for investigation
- **Integration**: Supporting synthesis across distributed contributions
- **Resolution**: Achieving shared understanding despite physical separation

## Why Facilitation is Key to Managing Presence

Facilitation serves as the active bridge between these three types of presence. In hybrid environments, facilitation becomes even more critical because:

1. **Presence Doesn't Happen Automatically**: Unlike traditional classrooms where physical proximity creates natural presence, hybrid environments require what Shea et al. (2006) termed "directed facilitation"—intentional instructor actions that actively guide learning across spaces. Without this deliberate facilitation, remote students in particular experience diminished presence and become "peripheral participants" (Romero-Hall & Vicentini, 2017).

2. **Facilitation Distributes Teaching Presence**: Research demonstrates that effective facilitation directly predicts students' sense of learning community. Through deliberate strategies like attention cycling and structured turn-taking, instructors can ensure teaching presence reaches all participants equally. As Heilporn et al. (2021) found, "what teachers do in their courses is linked with student engagement," but in hybrid contexts, this doing must be intentionally distributed across modalities.

3. **Facilitation Bridges Social Presence Gaps**: Active facilitation creates what doesn't occur naturally across physical-virtual boundaries. Studies show that teaching presence promotes social presence, which in turn enables cognitive presence (Chen et al., 2022). The facilitator must actively "command virtual presence that resonates with both in-person and remote learners" (InSync Training, 2025) by creating structured opportunities for cross-modal interaction.

4. **Facilitation Enables Cognitive Equity**: By managing participation patterns and discussion structures, facilitation ensures all students have opportunities for deep cognitive engagement. Without skilled facilitation, hybrid environments tend toward uneven cognitive experiences, with remote students experiencing less robust discourse. Effective facilitation acts as the "design, organization, facilitation, and direction" that promotes meaningful learning outcomes (Garrison et al., 2000).

## Connection to Triple Presence Theory

Building on Bülow's (2022) concept of "triple presence" introduced in Dimension 1, we recognize that hybrid learning occurs across three simultaneous contexts:

1. **Physical Classroom Environment** - The tangible space where some participants gather
2. **Digital Environment** - The virtual platform connecting all participants
3. **Remote Students' Contexts** - The diverse physical spaces from which remote students participate

Each type of presence (teaching, social, cognitive) must be cultivated across all three of these contexts. This creates a 3×3 matrix of presence considerations that effective facilitation must address.

## Equity and Universal Design Considerations

Creating equitable hybrid learning requires recognizing that presence is not experienced uniformly. Students experience presence differently based on their participation mode, technology access, and personal circumstances. Importantly, presence gaps compound inequities—students who experience weak social presence are less likely to engage cognitively, creating a cascade of disadvantage.

The three types of presence naturally align with Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles, providing a framework for inclusive hybrid design:

- **Teaching Presence + Multiple Means of Representation**: By ensuring instructional design and facilitation reach all learners regardless of location, teaching presence creates multiple pathways to access content and instruction.

- **Social Presence + Multiple Means of Engagement**: When cultivated across modalities, social presence provides varied pathways for connection and belonging, recognizing that students engage differently based on their contexts and preferences.

- **Cognitive Presence + Multiple Means of Action/Expression**: Equitable cognitive presence offers diverse ways for students to demonstrate understanding, whether contributing through verbal discussion, chat, collaborative documents, or other modalities.

Intentional design for presence thus becomes a key equity strategy, helping level the playing field across participation modes while honoring the diversity of learner needs and contexts. Rather than treating presence as a luxury, this framework positions it as an essential component of inclusive hybrid learning design.

## Mapping Toolkit Components to Presence Support

### Dimension 1: Learning Environment & Technology Design
- **Supports Teaching Presence** through technology selection and configuration that enables instructor visibility
- **Supports Social Presence** through creating spaces where all participants are equally visible
- **Supports Cognitive Presence** through tools that enable collaborative knowledge construction

### Dimension 2: Learning Experience & Assessment Design
- **Teaching Presence** embedded in activity design and assessment alignment
- **Social Presence** considered in group work and peer interaction activities
- **Cognitive Presence** structured through the Receiving → Responding → Creating progression
- **Modality Considerations Row** on planning tools ensures presence equity

### Dimension 3: Facilitation, Equity & Community Design
Each tool directly supports presence development:

| **Strategy Cards** | Discussion Orchestration, Attention Management | Connection Building, Participation Activation | All categories support sustained discourse |
| **Activity Cards** | Timeline structure ensures consistent facilitation | Community building across course phases | Progressive deepening of engagement |
| **Group Formation Guide** | Protocols for balanced facilitation | Mixed-modality grouping | Collaborative knowledge building |
| **Facilitation Essentials** | Core rhythms and habits | Verbal bridges and unity language | Attention distribution for ideas |
| **Troubleshooting Guide** | Diagnostic approach to presence gaps | Solutions for isolation and fragmentation | Addresses engagement barriers |

## Applying the Presence Lens

Use these established concepts to:
1. **Diagnose** presence gaps in your current hybrid teaching
2. **Design** learning experiences that intentionally build all three types of presence
3. **Select** appropriate tools and strategies from the toolkit
4. **Evaluate** the effectiveness of your presence-building efforts

Remember: In hybrid learning, presence is not a given—it's an achievement. Through intentional facilitation using the tools in this dimension, you can create learning environments where all students, regardless of location, experience full teaching presence, rich social presence, and deep cognitive presence.
