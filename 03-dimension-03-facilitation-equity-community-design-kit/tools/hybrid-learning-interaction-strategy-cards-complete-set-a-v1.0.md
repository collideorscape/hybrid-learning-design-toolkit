  3. Provide all access links/information in a single location accessible throughout
  4. Use consistent verbal and visual cues to signal upcoming transitions
  5. Build in buffer time and verification checks during transitions

- **Hybrid Considerations:**
  - **For remote students:** Ensure all platforms work with remote setup; provide early access for testing; establish fallback options for platform inaccessibility
  - **For on-site students:** Clarify device requirements for transitions; create physical movement plan that accommodates technology use; test all platforms on in-room equipment

- **Technology Requirements:**
  - Centralized link/resource repository
  - Transition timing indicators
  - Backup access methods
  - Optional: Platform integration tools



- **Companion Strategies:**
  - Full-Group Refocusing (A3)
  - Digital Task Verification (T4)
  - Attention Cycling (A2)

- **Works well with these activities:**
  - Multi-platform sessions

  - Simulation exercises
  - Tool-based learning

### T4: Digital Task Verification

**FRONT:**
- **FOCUS:** ● FACILITATION - Instructor techniques  ○ ENGAGEMENT - Student activation
- **DESCRIPTION:** Methods for confirming that all participants have successfully accessed and engaged with digital tasks or resources, preventing isolation due to technical issues. Ensures all students maintain connection to learning activities.
- **IMPLEMENTATION LEVEL:** ● ESSENTIAL  ● ENHANCED  ○ TRANSFORMATIVE
- **ACTIVITY TYPES:** Collaboration, Investigation, Assessment, Presentation

**BACK:**
- **Implementation Steps:**
  1. Design simple verification protocol for each digital task or resource (visual check, chat confirmation, response submission)
  2. Implement verification before proceeding with substantive activity
  3. Create systematic response to verification failures (buddy support, alternative access)
  4. Document persistent issues for follow-up
  5. Build verification into transitions and activity progression

- **Hybrid Considerations:**
  - **For remote students:** Establish clear verification signal method; provide alternative verification options; create private channel for assistance requests

  - Verification mechanism (poll, chat, reaction)
  - Tracking system for verification status
  - Optional: Automated access verification



- **Companion Strategies:**
  - Technology Buddy System (T2)
