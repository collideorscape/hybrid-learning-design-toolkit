# Hybrid Facilitation Essentials
*Core rhythms and routines for effective hybrid teaching*

## Introduction

The Hybrid Facilitation Essentials guide provides educators with practical routines and rhythms for managing synchronous hybrid learning environments where students participate simultaneously from physical and virtual spaces. This quick reference tool focuses on proactive facilitation practices that create equitable learning experiences across modalities. Unlike reactive troubleshooting, these essentials establish consistent patterns that prevent common hybrid teaching challenges through structured preparation, deliberate attention management, and inclusive facilitation habits.

## Side A: Pre-Session Setup & Opening

### Essential Preparation Checklist

**Environment & Technology:**
- [ ] Camera positioned to show teaching area + gestures
- [ ] Verify remote students can see/hear clearly  
- [ ] Display showing remote participants visible from teaching position
- [ ] All materials accessible in both physical and digital formats
- [ ] Backup communication channel ready (chat/phone)
- [ ] Platform features tested (breakouts, polls, screen share)
- [ ] Feedback tools prepared (rubrics visible to all, comment systems ready)

**Facilitation Preparation:**
- [ ] Review participant list and note participation modes
- [ ] Prepare opening that acknowledges both modalities
- [ ] Plan attention shifts every 7-10 minutes
- [ ] Identify students to engage from both modes early
- [ ] Note previous feedback given to maintain continuity
- [ ] Select 2-3 strategy cards for session activities

### Session Opening Protocol

1. **Acknowledge both spaces explicitly**
   - "Welcome to everyone here in the room and joining us online"
   - Make eye contact with camera AND room
   - Use names from both modalities early

2. **Establish participation norms**
   - How to ask questions (raise hand, chat, unmute)
   - Expected response modes for activities
   - When and how feedback will be provided

3. **Tech check moment**
   - "Remote participants, please confirm you can see/hear"
   - "Everyone accessing the shared document?"
   - Quick audio check from on-site students for remote peers

### Quick Reminders
- Start recording (if applicable)
- Share session materials link in chat
- Announce comfort protocols (cameras optional, breaks, etc.)
- Preview when/how students will receive feedback

## Side B: Core Facilitation Rhythms

### Attention Distribution Pattern

```
Every 7-10 minutes, explicitly shift focus:
Room â†’ Remote â†’ Room â†’ Remote
"Let's hear from online..." / "Turning to the room..."
```

### Essential Facilitation Habits

#### Visual Narration
- Describe physical actions: "I'm writing on the board..."
- Point to camera when addressing remote students
- Hold materials up to camera when showing
- Narrate any feedback being given verbally to ensure all hear

#### Verbal Bridges
- "Both groups will now..." (unity language)
- "While the room discusses, online please..."
- "Everyone, regardless of location..."
- "I'm providing feedback to [name] that everyone can learn from..."

#### Technology Rhythms
- Check chat every 3-5 minutes
- Verbalize key chat contributions
- Pause after questions for digital delay
- Say "switching screens" before transitions
- Acknowledge digital feedback submissions equally with physical

#### Participation Equity Habits
- Alternate question sources: room/remote/room/remote
- Name contributors: "As Sarah mentioned in chat..."
- Create parallel activities: "Room on whiteboard, remote in Jamboard"
- Track who has received verbal feedback to ensure balance

#### Feedback Rhythms âš¡
- **Balance feedback attention** across modalities in each session
- **Document verbal feedback** given to on-site students for remote access
- **Use multiple channels**: verbal, written, video comments
- **Quick check**: "Have I provided feedback to both remote and on-site students?"
- **Make feedback visible**: Share exemplars from both modalities
- **Schedule feedback moments** that work across time zones

### End-of-Session Protocol
- Synthesize contributions from both modalities
- Preview next session's format and expectations
- Remind students where to find/expect feedback
- Ensure all have access to follow-up resources
- Note: "Feedback will be available by [timeframe]"

### Quick Equity Reminder ðŸ“Œ
**Before ending any session, ask yourself:**
- Did both groups contribute equally?
- Did I provide feedback to students in both modalities?
- Are my follow-up resources accessible to all?
- Have I documented key discussions for those who couldn't attend synchronously?
