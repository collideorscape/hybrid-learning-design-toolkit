## Overview
Effective hybrid facilitation requires systematic strategies for managing discussion, attention, participation, technology, and community across dual participation modes. The Interaction Strategy Cards provide 25 research-based facilitation techniques organized by color-coded categories to address the most common challenges educators face when teaching simultaneously to on-site and remote students.

## Purpose
The Interaction Strategy Cards serve as practical facilitation support, enabling educators to:

- Manage discussion equity through structured participation protocols
- Distribute attention systematically across physical and virtual spaces
- Activate all students through diverse engagement techniques
- Handle technology challenges without disrupting learning flow
- Build community connections that bridge participation modes
- Implement research-based solutions for common hybrid teaching challenges
- Develop confident facilitation skills through proven, structured approaches

## How It Works
Cards are organized in five color-coded categories: Discussion Orchestration (Purple), Attention Management (Blue), Participation Activation (Green), Technology Integration (Gray), and Connection Building (Orange). Each card provides implementation steps, hybrid-specific considerations, technology requirements, and connections to companion strategies. The system supports different implementation levels (Essential, Enhanced, Transformative) allowing educators to match strategies to their context and capabilities.
