## Overview
Building cohesive learning communities across hybrid environments requires intentional activities designed to connect students regardless of their participation mode. The Community Building Cards provide 25 structured activities organized by course timeline phases, addressing the unique challenge of creating unified community identity when learners participate from both physical and virtual spaces throughout the semester.

## Purpose
The Community Building Cards serve as systematic community development support, enabling educators to:

- Create unified community identity across physical and virtual participation modes
- Address different phases of community development throughout courses
- Implement activities that prevent the formation of separate modal communities
- Build connections that support learning engagement and persistence
- Establish social presence foundations that enhance academic discourse
- Navigate the specific challenges of hybrid community formation
- Maintain community cohesion through course transitions and challenges

## How It Works
Cards are organized by course timeline phases (Beginning, Early Week, Midpoint, Later Course, Ending/Transition) with color-coded categories to support systematic community development. Each card provides implementation steps, hybrid adaptations, technology requirements, and pairing suggestions. Activities range from quick energizers to sustained connection-building experiences, all designed to create inclusive community experiences that bridge rather than divide participation modes.
