## Overview
When you're actively teaching a hybrid session, you need immediate, actionable guidance—not lengthy theory. The Hybrid Facilitation Quick Guide provides in-the-moment reference for essential routines, quick fixes for common challenges, and decision flows that help you respond effectively to hybrid facilitation issues as they arise.

## Purpose
The Facilitation Quick Guide serves as your in-session support system, enabling facilitators to:

- Execute essential setup and opening routines consistently
- Apply core facilitation rhythms that maintain presence across modalities
- Quickly diagnose and respond to common hybrid challenges
- Reference specific strategy cards based on identified problems
- Maintain attention patterns that prevent participation imbalances
- Handle technical barriers without losing teaching momentum
- Build energy and community connection during live sessions

## How It Works

The guide is organized for real-time use with three main components: **Essential Setup & Opening Routines** provide checklists and protocols for consistent session starts. **Core Facilitation Rhythms** establish attention patterns and essential habits that maintain connection across spaces. **Quick Fixes for Common Challenges** offers immediate responses to problems like silent remote students, participation imbalances, technical barriers, low energy, and community fragmentation.

Each challenge section includes warning signs to help with quick diagnosis, immediate actions you can take, and specific strategy card recommendations for deeper solutions. The guide concludes with decision flows and session flow templates that integrate card usage throughout typical hybrid sessions.

## Connection to Strategy Cards

The Quick Guide works as a bridge between the theoretical Presence Lens and the detailed Interaction Strategy Cards. When you identify a problem during facilitation, the guide helps you:

1. **Diagnose quickly** using presence framework concepts
2. **Respond immediately** with quick fixes and protocols  
3. **Apply targeted cards** based on the specific issue identified
4. **Maintain session flow** while implementing deeper solutions

The guide references specific card numbers (like A1, C3, D2) so you can quickly locate the detailed strategies you need.

## When to Use This Tool

- **Before sessions**: Review setup checklist and opening protocol
- **During sessions**: Quick troubleshooting when challenges arise
- **For new facilitators**: Essential routine reference until habits develop
- **In crisis moments**: Immediate guidance when things go wrong
- **For consistency**: Maintaining facilitation quality across sessions

The guide assumes you have access to the full Interaction Strategy Cards but need immediate guidance on which cards to use and when.

## Research Foundation

Based on empirical studies showing that hybrid facilitation quality determines learning outcomes more than technology sophistication. The routines integrate attention management research, showing that systematic rotation between modalities prevents the "second-class citizen" experience common in hybrid learning.

The quick fixes address the most frequently documented hybrid facilitation challenges, providing evidence-based responses that maintain both individual flexibility and community presence.
