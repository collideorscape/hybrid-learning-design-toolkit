## About the Hybrid Learning Design Toolkit

The Hybrid Learning Design Toolkit was created by [imaginary institute](https://imaginary.institute/) in collaboration with the Department of Social Sciences at Universit√† degli studi di Napoli Federico II, within the framework of [**EURIDICE** (EURopean Identity InClusive Education)](https://euridice.eu/), 


**imaginary institute** led the research, design, and development of the toolkit bringing together evidence-based practices from educational research with practical design thinking methodologies to create tools that are both theoretically grounded and immediately usable by educators.

**Lead Learning Experience Design and Research:** Stefano Perna
